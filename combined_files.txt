 against uh ~Matthew ~Collins,
r um,
. roughly seven-hundred dollars,

 uh=,
. during last uh August to September,
. okay,
d uh=,
 just tell me about how you arrived at uh this claim.
CHELL:	... Uh I was called by ... ~Matthew here,
. to= do the job for him.
 I went out and looked at the job,
GE:	.. Okay,
u run a --
u run a .. a carpet business I [presume]?
CHELL:	[Yes].
m a licensed contractor.
GE:	Okay.
CHELL:	... U=m,
e job was out at UCSB,
. I went and estimated the job for myself,
 see if I could take the job,
. for what he wanted to pay for it,
. and I let him know that I could not.
. Do the job.
. I wouldn't make any money.
. So uh,
. upon me .. telling him that,
. he offered,
. to pay ... my employees,
. fill out,
 had em fill out double-u two forms all of em,
. and <X he X> paid him,
 lessen the burden of payment on me,
. so that I in turn would make more money off the job.
. I agreed to that,
. after about --
GE:	... Ca- % .. i=s that a normal procedure XX,
CHELL:	Not at all.
. He wanted me to do the job,
. so he offered to take some of the monitory burden off my back,
. so that I could do it for the agreed amounts that we were gonna do it on.
GE:	.. So in other words,
ur --
ur helpers would really be his employees [for the purpose] of this job,
CHELL:	[That's correct].
 had em all fill out the plo- proper forms.
GE:	... So then your costs would be reduced there as far as,
CHELL:	.. That's correc[t].
GE:	[A]lright.
CHELL:	... Uh,
. I went to receive my check,
. of which,
. we had agreed,
 that he would deduct,
. the amount ... of .. the hourly wage,
. that [he was] --
GE:	[Was this a]greement in writing,
 verbal (Hx).
CHELL:	... Completely verbal.
ve been working with him for like six years.
. Uh,
 upon a reve- uh --
 ... receiving my check,
. uh=,
. for about ... two and a half weeks of work,
. approximately between fifty and seventy hours,
was paid three-hundred and sixteen dollars and fifty-one cents.
. So I approached him with it,
. and he handed me this yellow piece of paper here,
. and noted that,
. what the employees made,
. a=nd uh,
. at twenty-six percent less deduction on these two employees.
. Which was the employer contribution.
. So I= noted to him that he was supposed to pay that,
. he said,
= n-,
. no,
. you're gonna pay it.
. So I said that's not ... as per our agreement,
 said yes it is,
 handed me my check,
lled up his window,
d drove off.
. And he's there to state,
 he's --
. he saw that,
d was .. witness to that.
. I have [a letter],
GE:	[%I don- I don't] think it's relevant that he rolled up his window and drove off [2X2].
CHELL:	[2We2]ll,
know.
 But,
. that- --
at was the end of our thing,
tried to contact him everything,
. finally I uh .. contacted my attorney,
. I'd like to present this letter to you here.
GE:	... Okay.
 I may look at that.
d,
 [have you shown] that to uh Mister ~Collins?
CHELL:	[Yes please].
s.
 has --
 he has ... received ... a copy of that letter.
... (THROAT)
GE:	... Now ~Stu ~Roberts is an attorney.
 that correct?
CHELL:	.. Yes sir,
GE:	... You're uh,
CHELL:	... I'm his nephew.
GE:	<P You're his nephew P>.
. And you're ~Nick ~Ro- .. ~Roberts' nephew too then.
CHELL:	... That's correct,
GE:	.. Okay.
. So uh your uncle then wrote uh Builders uh a letter,
at's what I'm reading now,
CHELL:	... Yes sir,
GE:	... Uh I do emphasize that I'm reading it,
is is not evidence,
is is only y- your story,
a[t you've told] ... Mister ~Roberts,
CHELL:	[That's correct],
. That's correct,
GE:	<P Okay P>.
. (TSK) So really the dispute then boils down to this twenty-six percent.
CHELL:	.. That's it sir.
GE:	... Okay.
CHELL:	... That's the reason why I had him ... fill out that portion of,
 he ... wanted to ... write those checks.
 Was so I would save that money,
 I would do that job.
GE:	... Okay.
CHELL:	At the end of the job.
GE:	.. Mister ~Collins I know you're,
. biting at the bit there,
u wanna (Hx) say something,
 why don't you go ahead.
THEW:	.. Okay thank you your honor.
. U=m,
. uh pretty much (Hx),
 u=m,
. what ~Mitchell has stated is untrue.
. ~Mitchell,
. uh did do some work for me out at the college,
 did the Anacapa Residential Hall.
. A=nd this is a,
. eight-thousand-yard job,
 that we did this summer.
. (H) It required us to,
. employ,
. oh five or six crews,
. uh ~Mitchell ~Roberts was one of them that we used,
 the job,
. Uh ~Mitchell ... expressed a desire to do the work out there,
. he expressed,
. he did not know how to= handle the payroll.
. Most of the ... uh contractors here in town,
at are independents like ~Mitchell,
. don't know how to do prevailing wage [statements].
[(THROAT)]
THEW:	.. The college is a ... state-funded uh ... uh ... remodel,
. and on state-funded remodels,
're required,
. to pay prevailing wages.
. Uh prevailing wages,
 that,
. um,
. that indicate different ... levels of agility,
. of the different men working.
. And so,
 uh a lot of the crew=s,
. uh,
. like ~Mitchell,
 who have .. people that work ... under him,
 around town,
 .. regular situations,
. come to the people like me,
d ask us to do payroll for them.
. When we do the payroll for them,
. we state to them up front,
. that ... uh,
 will pay the payroll,
. we will make the deductions,
. and then .. the employer contribution,
. which is approximately twenty-six percent,
. over and above .... the hourly wage,
. is also deducted,
. from .. the .. um ... subcontractor's check.
GE:	.. Now this uh .. th- twenty-six percent,
at'd be .. be social security,
d what else would it include.
THEW:	... Um (Hx),
GE:	.. Sorta like um,
CHELL:	... <X Th[at's anything X> above] that.
THEW:	[Well you have] --
u have,
... XXX
THEW:	... you have that --
. I have a breakdown here,
 what we paid ~Mitchell's men.
GE:	[XXXXX]
THEW:	[if you'd like to see that].
GE:	... Okay.
. I mean,
 --
ah,
 you got a total of uh,
. seven point six five percent employer contributions on the,
THEW:	... Um,
. that explains it pretty well,
ere's quite a few deductions,
 of course- --
. [X],
GE:	[Oh] and and the oh the --
e f- --
e annual unemployment insurance,
d uh,
THEW:	Right.
GE:	Oka[y].
THEW:	[wor]ker's compensatio[2n,
GE:	[2Right2].
THEW:	F2]UDA .. FICA,
 cetera.
. Now that's,
. u=m,
. in any payroll deduction situation,
u have,
. the employee contribution,
. which is deducted from the employee's ... wages,
oss wages,
 and then you have the employer's ... contribution,
hich is over and] above that.
[(THROAT)]
THEW:	... Which the employer has to pay.
. Now the agreement that we had made,
. with a=ll of the ... um,
. subcontractors,
,
. ~Mark ~Preston's sitting here,
. which is testifying for ~Mitch ~Roberts,
. also did work for me,
. and he was treated the same way.
 .. paid him,
. we took his deductions out,
. as well as ... that,
. and,
 we,
 did that,
. with everybody.
GE:	... Okay wai- % --
wanna make sure now.
That would be fine if that was the agreement.
w you say that the w- --
u under- --
u explained that to Mister ~Roberts?
THEW:	... Uh yes sir.
 Before he went to work.
GE:	.. Okay.
ster ~Roberts,
d you have any conversations,
CHELL:	... Absolute[ly not].
GE:	[with ~Matthew] ~Collins about that.
CHELL:	... The reason,
. and I stress this.
d I don't like to waste the court's time.
. But,
. my ... total,
agree --
 If X> whatever he just said right there was true,
th ... withholding and every[thing].
GE:	[R]ight I'm --
CHELL:	... That was fine.
GE:	... It really boils [down],
CHELL:	[But] --
GE:	what- what was the discussion the agreement regarding this,
CHELL:	... The dis[cussion],
GE:	[X]
CHELL:	The agreement would be,
at he would pay everything.
. So that [I wouldn't] --
GE:	[Did he say eve]rything.
CHELL:	Y- everything.
. So that I wouldn't end up making,
ter fifty hou- fifty hours work,
ich I knew I was gonna make,
en I had to <X play X> my em- part of an employer contribution,
. I have my own payroll service.
ey do all that for me,
d they're very familiar with all ... types of pay.
. This is why I didn't wanna take the job to begin with.
GE:	... Uh [I can u- --
CHELL:	[He in turn] --
GE:	I can] appreciate that.
 [2now2],
CHELL:	[2Okay2],
GE:	.. Mister ~Collins says,
. he denies that you said,
. everything.
ght?
X He just X>] --
CHELL:	[I wouldn't]'ve --
wouldn't[2've done it2].
THEW:	[2Well2],
GE:	... You have a different .. story,
 what .. the agreement was.
THEW:	.. Right.
. U=m,
 uh ~Karen here,
. uh,
es all the payroll,
nd .. uh,
. she's here to testify about a conversation,
. that .. her and ~Mitchell had,
 our office,
out this very thing,
d I'd [like to] --
GE:	[Before] or after the= agreement was entered into.
THEW:	.. After the agreement was entered into,
. he had been on the job for about a week or so,
. and,
 was time,
. I believe for the-,
. first or second pay ... period for his men,
. Uh he came into the office,
d had a conversation with ~Karen,
. about,
. A the payroll,
. and B this twenty-six percent that we're talking about.
d [she'd be hap]py to tell you --
GE:	[Okay ma'am],
 why don't you please,
 explain the= conversation you had with Mister ~Roberts.
EN:	... Okay.
m,
 was --
. we were going over the wages for ~Phil ~Nigel,
 who was one of the .. gentlemen on there,
. as to .. how much .. ~Phil was to get,
. for the job.
 On an hourly basis.
. A=nd,
 had mentioned to me,
at he was wanting him to get ex amount,
) and I said okay,
 it's ex amount to ~Phil,
en,
us twenty-six percent means,
take out ... this amount,
. from your check.
. And he goes oh.
ll then .. no,
don't wanna have the,
u know,
ke out that much.
) So= we were going back and forth with the figures,
d so finally,
. this is .. the=,
. uh=,
. wage that we came up with,
ich was thirteen [fifty to] ~Phil,
[(THROAT)]
EN:	... And then have seventeen dollars .. an hour,
ken out of ~Mitch ... 's check.
. ~Mitch ~Roberts' check.
. And this is the (H) note that I'd written down on that.
nd then,
. you can see that thirteen fifty plus twenty-six percent,
ich is three fifty-one,
) would actually equal to seventeen o one,
nd I said,
THEW:	[Why don't you show him the note].
EN:	.. You know],
. just the seventeen was [2fine2].
GE:	[2<X Oh this X>2] --
. So,
 did you have [that conver]sation.
CHELL:	[I don't] --
. I had that perfect conversation with her.
 And that's very true,
actly what you said.
. But she never told me anything about,
. this twenty-six percent,
at was coming a- come out of my check.
. Why- --
 It's --
... go ahead.
K:	... I was offered,
atthew offered me,
m ~Mark ~Preston,
m a licensed contractor also,
d ~Matthew (H) offered me the same ... situation.
. And it was my understanding,

pply the glue,

d take care of my guys,
d make the payroll,

GE:	[But],
u don't have any --

GE:	unless I'm wrong,
out the conversation those two had.

K:	[I] know for a fact that,

THEW:	[2He was not there2].
K:	M- and- --
 just mentioned that he --
) ~Matthew just mentioned that he deducted the same out of my check?

worked strictly by the yard,
d I paid my people.
 [Prevailing wages].
GE:	[Well any agreement he had] with you is not relevant to the agreement he had with Mister ~Roberts.
K:	Well,
 I saw the people's checks,
. a=nd,
. I'm just drawing a pi-,
rify what ~Mitch said.
. H- ~Ma- Mister ~Collins was supposed to pay ... everything.
CHELL:	... He approached him [with the same],
K:	[Fir- f- f-] --

K:	[(THROAT)]
GE:	that may have been on other cases,
e question is,
d he do it in this case.
CHELL:	.. He --
 it would be,

.. %uh,
.. the whole reason why I'm here.
... Is because he took that twenty-six percent out,
that he told me he wasn't gonna take,
... he used it as,
.. more or less bait me to do the job,
... and went ahead and withheld it from me.
... Without saying a word to it,
I had nothing,
.. I was expecting to make about a thousand dollars on the job,
UDGE:	I understand that.
ITCHELL:	... And,
.. when he wrote my check.
... He wrote my check to me,
... handed it to me through a window,
... says that's the way it is,
... and th- --
and and you know --
it wasn't --
and- he % totally evaded me,
.. he has to this day evaded me,
UDGE:	.. Mister ~Roberts.
.. That's beside the point.
What I'm trying to % --
... We have to really hone in on-,
what was the agreement.
Not how he [paid you,
ITCHELL:	[The agreement was,
UDGE:	If he --
ITCHELL:	.. That],
UDGE:	.. You know],
I don't care if he folded an airplane and ma- --
and sailed [it through the air],
ITCHELL:	[He would pay] all my employees.
That was the agreement.
... [Everything].
UDGE:	[But he di-] --
he disputes that.
ITCHELL:	... Well,
I understand that.
That's why we're here your honor.
UDGE:	.. <WH Okay WH>.
... But,
you're the plaintiff.
You have the burden of proving your case.
That's the problem I have is,
... you've gotta convince me by a preponderance of evidence,
that what you're saying is true.
ITCHELL:	... [Well then if] --
UDGE:	[More- --
more li]kely than not.
.. Now you say one thing,
and he says another,
ITCHELL:	... Then --
when- when a person .. fills out,
or has other employees fill out the double-u two forms and everything,
... why would I become liable,
... for that contribution.
When h- .. when he in fact by law,
is now employing those employees.
... He's the employer.
... I am doing nothing.
... (H) Isn't there a law that states that fact?
... When you have,
... uh people,
... work for you,
and fill out specific forms to the state,
... [stating that]?
UDGE:	[Tell me again].
Wh- --
what were the --
what was the agreement again?
Go- go through the --
.. y- conversation as you saw it.
ITCHELL:	... Conversation was,
~Mitch,
if you do this job,
... I'll go ahead and pay all your employees,
and you in turn will be able to pa- make more money.
UDGE:	... That was pretty much it.
ITCHELL:	... That's it.
... That's to the point,
UDGE:	Oh [so he in ef]fect said,
ITCHELL:	[And that's it].
UDGE:	I will pay your employ[2ees2].
ITCHELL:	[2That2]'s correct.
... And he did sir.
... And then when it came to the employer contribution,
... without my knowledge or anything,
until I received this check,
... he just yanked that right out of my check.
UDGE:	... And Mister ~Collins %,
... that conv- --
tell me about the conversation .. you believe .. happened,
ATTHEW:	... Well,
... u=m,
... ~Mitch and I,
.. u=m,
~Mitch had come to me and said he would do the work out there,
... but he wanted to do the work under the basis that I paid his men,
... and I told him about,
... what I said earlier here,
UDGE:	.. About the twenty-six percent?
ATTHEW:	Yes,
UDGE:	That was mentioned to him.
AREN:	[Always].
ATTHEW:	[Oh yes].
Uh,
always,
it was mentioned with ~Karen here,
on her note of nine two ninety-three,
that she wrote down her note that she talked with him,
RADIO:	<X Twelve fourteen X>.
ATTHEW:	... and .. at .. uh,
at every juncture.
... He was --
... uh made aware of,
... the= uh,
the contributions,
... were made by the employer.
These were his men,
.. and we were doing a service for him,
... under this agreement that we had between us.
UDGE:	.. Now just --
% just seems from a logical standpoint,
I wasn't there obviously,
it seems like if you had said that to him,
he would've said wait a minute,
it's not worth it to me.
ITCHELL:	... That's cor[rect].
UDGE:	[Would you] --
Would you think he would say that.
ATTHEW:	Yes,
I would think he would.
... [Why would he] do the work.
UDGE:	[Okay].
ITCHELL:	... So you would trick me into doing it.
... [Tho-] --
UDGE:	[Well] not if he,
not if he said [2to you2],
ITCHELL:	[2No2],
but [3.. then,
ATTHEW:	[3@ .. @@3]
ITCHELL:	Then3],
with all my --
.. with my .. fourteen years experience.
Why would I do that amount .. amount of work,
and knowingly for over fifty hours of work,
UDGE:	... Well I [XX] --

UDGE:	[2That may be a like a2] buyer's remorse,

ITCHELL:	[Well tha]t's not --

UDGE:	... Well,
I'll tell you.
% if Mister ~Roberts' testimony is correct he should win,
and Mister ~Collins' testimony is correct then he should prevail.
ITCHELL:	And I agree with you.
UDGE:	... (H) [Now-] --
ITCHELL:	[But the] fact remains,
that I would not have done the work,
.. for this amount of money.
... That's why I turned the job down to begin with.
... That's why I'm here in the court today,
to make .. the court decide.
... It shouldn't --

... Now,
you both seem very truthful and honest.

ATTHEW:	[I] will appeal.
UDGE:	... @Okay.

   	... !Ron was s=inglehandedly there.
   	... @ .. with one wrecker.
   	... G- yeah=.
:  	... (THROAT)
   	... Seems like any time I've seen a wrecker out here,
   	there's always two guys in there.
:  	Hm-m X,
   	@everyone was gone,
   	when the call came in.
   	... Oh=.
:  	And !Jay's not supposed to go on those anymore,
   	because of his heart,
   	... (H) (TSK) so he had to send !Ron by himself,
   	and !Ron was s=lowly pulling everybody out of the ditch.
   	... Did they all hit each other?
   	Or just,
:  	.. Kind of.
   	.. A%- a% semi ... bumped a car,
   	and then went and,
   	... went on two wheels,
   	and,
   	... just about lost it,
   	and then ... (TSK) got back up on all ... all its wheels again.
   	... Oh=.
   	... Did it land [in the ditch]?
:  	                [But it (Hx)]= --
   	... Kind of,
   	it was able to get out,
   	(H) but all the other cars that were ... in the .. direct ... vicinity,
   	all hit the ditch.
   	... And then,
   	... there was three cars .. and the semi.
   	... (H) And then,
   	... this uh,
   	... this guy ... pulled up and,
   	(DRINK)
:  	.. he was going to uh,
   	... (H)= !Peggy,
   	... (SWALLOW)
:  	(YAWN) (YAWN) you remember !Peggy !White?
   	... (TSK) Yeah.
:  	Her husband,
   	!Gary !Bighare?
   	Mhm?
:  	... Him and her pulled up,
   	and they were in the van?
   	... And they stopped to ask !Ron what happened?
   	... And here another car came and rear-ended em.
   	... (TSK) (H) Oh=[=].
:  	                 [And they] ended up having to take um= ... !Peggy !White ... by helicopter to Billings.
   	... Man that's pretty ba=d.
:  	... I know.
   	... Darn,
   	... this darn dog keeps ... breathing,
   	<X and like X> ... dreaming,
   	<X you know X> I wonder if we should wake her up?
   	... No,
   	.. she'll get scared and want to go outside.
   	... Kinda nervous,
   	you know.
:  	... They say you can really ... mess up a dog,
   	by waking em up when they're dreaming.
   	.. Really?
:  	... Mhm.
   	... It's so cold outside,
   	but yet sometimes she insists on staying out there.
   	I know=.
   	... You know what I was thinking of doing?
:  	Hunh.
   	... I don't know,
   	she's kind of shy,
   	but I was [wondering],
:  	          [(SNEEZE)]
   	... [2what it2] would be like to ... train her,
:  	    [2(SNIFF)2]
   	... to pull a sled.
:  	... I don't know if she'd do it.
   	... I don't know if she would either.
   	... She's kind of timid.
:  	.. Mhm.
   	... She doesn't trust too many people at all.
   	... Yeah=.
:  	... (SNIFF) ... (SWALLOW) Oh and you know another thing that ~Tim had the audacity to bitch about?
   	.. What.
:  	... He said um,
   	... ~Mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree.
   	... until four in the morning.
   	... And I even asked if we could put our ornaments on there,
   	and they told me <X that X> .. there wouldn't be enough room.
   	... Really=?
:  	Mhm,
   	.. ~Tim said that.
   	... (TSK) (H) She was probably lonely when she was doing it,
   	you know that?
   	... She probably was.
   	... [X] --
:  	    [I] sat up with her,
   	and I was talking to her,
   	she was doing all the decorating,
   	.. I mean,
   	(H)= ... what was I gonna do.
   	She- I mean,
   	she was just .. putting up the balls and everything and,
   	... (H) she'd say <Q where,
   	... where do you think this should go Q> and,
   	... so I was sitting there doing my Welfare application.
   	... And uh=,
   	... @you @know I was just sitting there watching her,
   	telling her ... (H) where to put everything and what not.
   	... Did you know !Nickie wanted her own tree=?
:  	... Ye=s?
   	... And I forgot to bring it in,
   	it's outside?
:  	... What are you gonna do with it.
   	... She wants to set it up for her Barbies.
   	... I was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom?
:  	.. Mhm.
   	.. And just stick it in there.
   	... (SWALLOW) (TSK) (H) And you know what I did?
:  	Hm.
   	I [didn't] want to waste a tree's life,
:  	  [(TSK)]
   	... so I just cut a <@ branch off one @>.
   	... (H) ... God,
   	<X I fell up there X>.
   	... (DRINK)
:  	Where'd you go.
   	... to get em.
   	... You know where !Sarah and !Arvela live?
:  	.. Mhm,
   	.. Just around the corner.
   	... Remember that first .. cattle guard you go over?
:  	... Unhunh,
   	I didn't even go over that.
:  	... You mean,
   	... kinda like .. by the --
   	... by the [tunnel]?
   	           [Right below the] tunnel.
:  	... Oh=.
   	... And I just walked up --
   	... W=e just walked up around uh,
   	that area,
   	(H) God ~Alice that was f=u=n.
:  	(H) Did you get grandma a tree too?
   	Hunh-unh.
:  	... Does she already have one?
   	... Hm-m.
   	... (TSK) That pickup could only hold like three.
:  	... Mm.
   	... I wonder why --
   	.. Did daddy say to take the pickup back?
   	Or what was the [deal].
   	                [Yeah].
   	.. Yeah.
:  	Why.
   	... Cause !Phoebe needs it.
:  	... What's wrong with the car.
   	... (H)
   	Oh,
   	you didn't hear about it?
:  	Hunh-unh.
   	... Oh,
   	you did,
   	about how the .. engine was on fire?
:  	.. Mhm,
   	... See there was oil spilling out,
   	... leaking out from ... the valve cover.
:  	... Mhm.
   	The valve cover gasket apparently cracked or whatever,
   	and there was oil coming out,
   	(H) .. and the oil got hot,
   	and you know how it gets hot and smokes?
:  	Mhm.
   	... Well,
   	I guess enough came out,
   	... because we were losing oil bad,
   	... going from Billings to .. Crow,
   	um,
   	... there's a lot of &
:  	(DRINK)
   	& smoke coming out,
   	and by the time we got to Hardin,
   	we had to put like uh=,
   	... three or four quarts in.
:  	... Unhunh.
   	... It was three.
   	.. (H)= .. An=d (Hx),
   	.. by the time we got to &
:  	... (H)
   	& Crow,
   	... it was=,
   	... it was one quart low.
   	... And there was smoke still coming from under the engine,
   	I figure w- if it was losing that much oil,
   	(H) then <X it X> caught fire.
:  	Mhm.
   	Cause the engine was hot,
   	cause there wasn't .. enough water in the ... radiator.
:  	... Mhm.
   	(TSK) I talked to !Oscar about it,
   	and he said,
   	(H) well I checked,
   	it was only,
   	.. it was only about,
   	I'd say a half a quart to a quart short of water.
   	... But that shouldn't make any difference.
   	He goes the only thing I can think of,
   	(H) is that there was an air lock in there.
:  	    [(THROAT)]
   	... [And that] running the engine out on the open road?
:  	.. Mh[2m2].
   	     [2C2]aused that air lock to come through.
   	... [3flushed it out3].
:  	    [3And bust th3]e ... gasket?
   	... No=,
   	... it would more or less um,
   	... the engine wasn't being kept cool enough.
   	... Cause there [wasn't enough] fluid .. in the radiator.
:  	                [(DRINK)]
   	Unhunh,
   	... And,
   	you know how the radiator's,
   	the pipe's close to other parts of the en[gine]?
:  	                                         [Yeah]=.
   	... So what &
   	It was some [part in there].
:  	& [caused the f]ire.
   	... The engine being too hot,
   	.. and the oil leaking,
:  	... So he knew that the oil was leaking?
   	No,
   	... (TSK) we knew we were losing oil,
   	but we didn't know where.
   	I just figured it was from= that valve cover gasket.
   	... Just from lifting up the hood and looking at it.
:  	... (H) So what's he gonna do.
   	... Well,
   	.. %and two of his wires,
   	the sparkplug wires?
:  	... Unh[unh].
   	       [were] fried all the way through.
:  	... Unhunh.
   	.. So we took those off and we,
   	.. replaced them with some old ones out of the garage.
:  	.. I knew tha=t.
   	And it runs.
   	... It runs.
   	There's enough uh=,
   	... radiator fluid in there.
:  	... Mhm.
   	... so that it will,
   	... It's .. it's enough.
:  	... Mhm.
   	... (DRINK) But I think running it out on the open road,
   	will cause it ... possibly to shoot more oil out.
:  	... Mhm.
   	That valve cover gasket has to be replaced.
:  	... Hm.
   	... (Hx)
   	... I don't know.
   	(H) Oh I freaked !Cookie and,
   	... !Rita and,
   	... !Gary out tonight.
   	... Remember the Plain- .. Plainfeather uh .. Claypit?
   	... where that red clay is?
:  	... Mhm.
   	... Right there.
   	... I saw my .. my speedometer just go Brr=.
   	.. like that just dow=n.
   	(H) You know,
   	and I knew exactly what it was.
   	... What I have to do,
   	is take off the distributor wire,
   	and splice it in with the fuel pump wire.
:  	... [Mhm].
   	    [Because] my= .. fuel pump is now electric,
   	.. Never used to be.
:  	... Mhm.
   	... Hand me that ashtray.
   	... Or your light,
   	I mean.
   	.. <P Your light P>.
   	... (H) It's behind the sewing machine.
   	(H)
:  	(THROAT)
   	And uh=,
   	... sometimes it gets loose.
:  	... (YAWN)
   	And .. no more <HI fuel HI>.
:  	(YAWN0 Unhunh,
   	So I stopped the car,
   	and they said what are you doing.
   	I said,
   	<Q oh,
   	I gotta tighten this wire here Q>.
   	... (H) ... So I had !Cookie .. turn on the ignition and turn it off.
   	... So,
   	.. cause see,
   	once you turn that key on,
   	... then you hear the%,
   	.. the fuel pump .. come on.
:  	... Mhm.
   	... And if the wire's not connected right,
   	.. it doesn't come on.
:  	... Mhm.
   	... So I did that,
   	... and I lit a match to find out where I was,
   	and,
   	... n- after everything was hunky-dory,
   	.. then I,
   	... shut the hood,
   	and got back in,
   	and I started up the engine and,
    	(H) both !Gary and !Rita were sitting on the edges of their seat.
     	... (SWALLOW) And I turned around and I looked,
     	.. and I said,
     	... <Q did I scare you kids Q>?
     	... (H) They wouldn't say anything,

DY:	... And that was good,
 it was real good planning,

 For lack of a better word.

 those guys,

 in the whole fan,
 of all our departures.
. And um,
DY:	.. Hm.
CE:	.. I think they're,

DY:	.. [Yeah].

DY:	[2Yeah2].

... (H) Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen,
'd like to welcome you to the Kentucky Horse Park,
 the Hall of Champions presentation.
e have four geldings and one stallion that we'll present for you this afternoon,
and as we bring them out,
l give you the history on each one,
please feel free to take all the pictures that you want,
to ask questions.
first horse here today at the Hall of Champions,
ur only thoroughbred stallion.
his is Bold Forbes.
H) Bold Forbes is a dark bay or brown stallion,
he was foaled in nineteen seventy-three.
He is by the stallion Irish Castle,
out of the unraced mare Comely Nell.
He was bred by Lee Eaton,
Red Bull Stables.
This grandson of Bold Ruler was entered into a sale in July of nineteen seventy-four.
H) Mister Estaban Tizol,
nker and real estate developer from Puerto Rico,
liked Bold Forbes' pedigree.
he liked this horse so much,
that he decided he was going to buy him,
atter what the cost.
H) The cost ended up being fifteen-thousand two-hundred dollars,
and Bold Forbes was then shipped to El Commandante racetrack in San Juan Puerto Rico.
(H) In Bold Forbes' very first start in Puerto Rico as a two-year-old,
he went off at odds of thirty-five to one,
nd he won that race by seventeen lengths.
(H) He was entered into four more races,
e won them all,
and in doing so,
was named champion two-year-old in Puerto Rico.
. (H) Well El Commandante is the only racetrack in Puerto Rico,
) so it didn't take Bold Forbes too long to run out of competition.
. (H) So in the summer of nineteen seventy-five,
 was shipped to New York,
 his new trainer Laz Barrera.
. (H) In New York he won the Freemont Stakes,
d the Saratoga Special,
fore he injured his shins,
d was given the rest of the year off.
. (H) Well all of Bold Forbes's races up to this point had been sprints,
 six furlong races.
) The Kentucky Derby is a much longer race,
 a mile and a quarter.
. So as a three-year-old,
rbes wasn't given much of a chance at all in the Kentucky Derby.
. (H) But his trainer had more confidence in him than that,
) and with Angel Cordero junior in the saddle,
) Bold Forbes won the Kentucky Derby,
 odds of seventeen to one,
. one length in front of the leader,
 Honest Pleasure.
. (H) The Preakness however was a disappointment for Bold Forbes.
 cut his left hind heel during the race,
t he still managed to run third.
. (H) But when the Belmont rolled around,
 had that all healed up,
d he won the Belmont stakes by a neck.
. (H) In October,
rbes was entered into the Vosburgh Handicap,
d again he severely bruised his right hind foot.
) Again he ran a very game third,
t after this race,
 was considered too valuable a breeding stallion to risk any more injury.
) So he was retired to stud from the track.
. (H) Bold Forbes was syndicated to stud for a hundred and thirty thousand dollars per share,
) and he stood his entire career at Arthur Hancock Stone Farm.
. (H) As a stallion,
ld Forbes produced a champion filly Tiffany Lass,
winner of over half a million dollars,
) Bold Apparel,
champion filly in Italy,
) Air Forbes One,
d over two-hundred other winners.
) .. Bold Forbes is a winner of over half a million dollars,
 just two years on the racetrack.
) He was in eighteen races,
d had thirteen wins,
d was never worse than third.
. (H) He was retired from stud duty in the spring of nineteen ninety-one.
 (H) He is twenty-one years old,
d stands fifteen point three hands tall.
 (H) Ladies and gentlemen,
e nineteen seventy-six Kentucky Derby winner,
 Bold Forbes.
Y:	.. ((APPLAUSE))
RA:	.. Does anyone have any questions,
ile we're waiting for the next horse to come out.
. Questions?
. Okay,
ile we're waiting,
ll just call everyone's attention to this horse,
 @don't @know if everyone can see him,
) %over here in this paddock on= the right,
) this is Sergeant Pepper Feature,
d,
's usually in our show,
t,
cause Bold Forbes is up here today,
 --
 kicked him out.
 have six horses that belong to the Hall of Champions,
) and only five stalls.
 we could only have five at a time in the show.
)= Um,
rgeant Pepper was the nineteen eighty-two world champion racing quarter horse,
) and,
 the time of his retirement,
 was the eighth richest quarter horse in history,
) and he had earnings of over nine-hundred thousand dollars.
. So,
 your way out .. today,
u might wanna just take a look over there,
d say hi to Sergeant Pepper.
.
d there's Bold Forbes looking out the window.
 If anybody can see him,
's right there,
) watching the show @>.
.
) Our next horse is the first horse to retire here to the Hall of Champions,
at is not a racehorse.
. This is Imperator.
d he is a five-gaited American Saddlebred showhorse.
. (H) Perry,
 he is commonly called,
 by the sire Supreme Sultan,
o is buried in front of the saddlehorse museum here at the Horse Park.
 (H) He is out of the dam Empress Wing,
 and she is by the great sire Wing Commander.
) Only Wing Commander holds more world grand championships than Imperator.
 (H) Perry was born in Wilmette Illinois,
) and he was purchased there as a two-year-old,
 his owner,
ctor Geraldine Meanor,
) and then sent to his trainer,
n Harris,
 Simpsonville Kentucky.
 (H) Now Perry and Mister Harris had a very special bond that they shared.
) They both had the same birthday.
) And as the years went past,
d Imperator's popularity increased,
) Mister Harris didn't get too upset when Perry received more birthday cards and presents than he did.
. (H) Being five-gaited means that Perry performs the three natural gaits,
 the walk trot and canter,
) plus two manmade gaits,
e slow gait and the rack.
. (H) The only difference in these gaits are the speed at which they're performed.
. Perry's greatest accomplishment was winning the five-gaited world grand championship four times.
) And he has also been reserve world champion five times.
. (H) He was shown eighty-five times,
 forty-four shows around the country.
) He has sixty-eight blue ribbons,
irteen seconds,
d very rarely was he ever worse than third.
. (H) Now the first time Perry was shown,
 was very wild and inexperienced,
d he stepped on just about every foot in the show ring.
) And he even chased the judges out of the ring on several occasions.
. (H) But the second time he was shown,
 had improved so much,
) the judges said he would have won if he'd been lying on his back,
 with all four feet stuck up in the air.
. (H) Perry's most beautiful characteristic during his show career was his tail.
 (H) At the highlight of his career,
) .. Perry's tail was fourteen feet long,
d could be wrapped completely around his body.
. If you wanted to take a picture of all of Perry,
) you had to take two pictures to include all of his tail.
 (H) When Perry was retired,
ster Harris cut his tail,
 make it easier to care for,
) and he was able to make three false tails from the hair he had taken from Perry's tail.
 (H) Well Perry had been retired here for about two years,
) but had never had a formal retirement.
) So in August of nineteen ninety-one,
rry was formally retired at the world championship horse show in Louisville Kentucky.
 (H) That night,
perator and his trainer,
ster Don Harris,
) stepped into the ring,
e last time together,
) and were both named the American Saddlebred horse and trainer for the decade of the nineteen-eighties.
. (H) Perry is now twenty years old,
d stands fifteen point three hands tall.
) Ladies and gentlemen,
e four-time world grand champion,
 Imperator.
Y:	.. ((APPLAUSE))
RA:	.. Does anyone have any questions,
ile we're --
s.
:	... What's the average age that a horse lives to.
RA:	(H) A good average is about twenty-eight,
 they're well taken care of.
,
lotta horses will live into their thirties.
. (H) A- a good way to compare horse ages to humans,
 to multiply by three.
. And --
cept,
think the oldest liv- --
,
dest horse on record,
think in the Guinness Book of World Records,
s sixty-two @.
. So don't multiply that .. that one by three.
 That would be what,
) a hundred and eighty-six .. <X or something X> (H) @>.
 Are there any other questions?
. No?
. If anyone's interested in seeing what Perry looked like,
en he had his fourteen-foot tail,
) um,
en you come into the visitor center,
don't know if- if .. anybody noticed this,
) there's a TV monitor right after you --
 Where you b=uy your tickets when you come in,
d you look up,
d there's a --
) An ongoing Hall of Champions presentation on this TV monitor up there,
) and uh,
ere's a little clip of Imperator on there,
d I think he's slowgaiting,
 which was his most .. beautiful gait,
 (H) um,
d you can see his fourteen-foot tail up there,
d that was- --
 was really beautiful.
 (SNIFF) ...
 you have a question?
. Back there?
:	... He wants to know how you say hi to a horse.
RA:	... Um,
. just say hi @.
 You can just say hi,
d they- --
d you can say their name,
 cause they know their names.
. So if you wanted to say hi to Imperator,
st --
 And he goes by Perry,
 if you just come up to him and say <VOX hi Perry VOX>,
'll know you're talking to him.
. (H) Our next horse is one of our two thoroughbred geldings here at the Hall of Champions,
is is Forego.
. (H) Forego is by the Argentine stallion Forli,
 and he is out of the champion race mare Lady Golconda.
. He was bred and raised at Claiborne Farm in Paris Kentucky.
 (H) Due to Forego's large size,
 was not raced as a two-year-old,
) because his owners thought they would give him more time to mature.
. (H) He started his racing career as a three-year-old.
d he ran well enough to be entered in the nineteen seventy-three Kentucky Derby.
. (H) Well you may recall that this was the year that a horse named Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby,
) on his way to sweeping the Triple Crown.
. (H) Well Forego wasn't as successful as Secretariat that day,
) But he did run a fine race.
. (H) He was involved in a bumping incident,
 the horses left the starting gate.
) He recovered from that,
 but he and another horse,
r Native,
) bumped through the entire stretch,
d both horses ended in a photo finish for third.
. After the steward's inquiry,
) Forego had to settle for fourth,
 because the steward said the bumping was all his fault.
. (H) The older Forego got,
e better he got,
d he became one of the greatest handicap horses to ever race.
) He has also been voted one of the top ten racehorses of the century.
. (H) Being a handicap horse means that Forego ha- --
rego had to carry a lot of extra weight,
) over whatever distance he was asked to run,
) in order to give the other horses more of a chance.
. (H) He was in thirty-four handicap events,
d thirty times,
 was the high-weighted horse.
. (H) The most weight Forego ever had to carry to victory,
s a hundred and thirty-seven pounds.
) And that was in the nineteen seventy-six Marlboro Cup.
. (H) Well before the race it had rained,
d the track was sloppy,
) and Forego was always a little wimpy about getting his feet wet.
. So as the field turned for home,
 looked just as if he was hopelessly beaten,
me ten lengths behind the leader Honest Pleasure.
. (H) Honest Pleasure had been the Kentucky Derby favorite that year,
. He was three years younger than Forego,
) and was carrying almost twenty pounds less in weight.
. But determined to win,
) Forego made up that last quarter mile,
 twenty-two seconds flat,
) and he beat Honest Pleasure at the wire.
. The jockey that rode Forego,
e great Willy Shoemaker,
) said there wasn't a horse alive,
at could've beaten Forego on that day.
. (H) Forego was named horse of the year,
ree consecutive years,
 nineteen seventy-four seventy-five and seventy-six.
) And he has also been champion sprinter,
 well as champion handicap horse.
. (H) An Eclipse Award is the highest honor a thoroughbred can receive.
) And Forego holds eight Eclipse Awards,
ich is more than any other horse.
. Forego retired in nineteen seventy-eight,
) with earnings of over one point nine million dollars,
ich made him the second richest thoroughbred in history at that time,
hind Kelso.
. (H) He was inducted into racing's hall of fame in nineteen seventy-nine.
. (H) Forego is one of our senior citizens here at the Hall of Champions,
) he is twenty-four years old,
d stands a very impressive (H) seventeen point one hands tall.
. Ladies and gentlemen,
e great handicap horse,
. Forego.
Y:	... ((APPLAUSE))
RA:	... Does anyone have any questions?
. Questions?
.
 Okay X>,
) Oh.
 Okay,
) I don't have my glasses on,
couldn't see you [(H)]@>.
:	[What] is the average weight for a horse.
RA:	... Um it varies,
,
. like .. probably,
. (TSK) let's see,
rego probably weigh=s around t-,
. oh about twelve hundred,
. maybe twelve fifty,
) some of the draft horses weigh over a to=n,
. in the draft horse barn,
me of the --
e Belgians are the biggest horses.
. The- the Shires are the tallest,
t the Belgians are the heaviest.
d --
 Have you been to the draft barn yet?
. % Did you see Roy and Captain,
. <SM the two big Belgians SM>,
. They weigh,
 they both weigh over two th- --
th- --
know .. Roy does.
m not sure about Captain,
t Roy weighs over two thousand pounds.
. Yes.
:	.. Isn't Secretariat,
. didn't he die=,
d wasn't he buried on <X this [property] somewhere X>.
RA:	[Uh],
 uh he's buried at Claiborne Farm.
:	Claiborne.
RA:	Mhm.
:	... How did he die.
RA:	... Pardon?
:	.. How did he die.
RA:	.. He was put down,
 had laminitis,
 which is a disease of the h- --
 the hoof,
. and and they put him down.
. (H) Our next horse to come out today,
 our other thoroughbred gelding to be retired here,
) and you'll see that he's a lot smaller than Forego.
. This is John Henry.
. (H) John Henry is the horse that comes from very humble beginnings.
) He is by the stallion Old Bob Bowers,
o was not much of a racehorse or a stallion either.
 (H) And he is out of the brood mare Once Double,
) who outside of John Henry,
d very little success as a brood mare.
. (H) John was born on March ninth nineteen seventy-five,
 Golden Chance Farm in Paris Kentucky.
 (H) The farm kept John until nineteen seventy-six,
en he was consigned to the Keenenland January Mixed Sale.
 (H) Now this sale is not a very good time to sell a horse,
) it's usually when people try to sell the horses they don't think are worth feeding through the winter.
. (H) So because of his small size,
s lack of pedigree,
t most of all,
s very nasty disposition,
) John brought only eleven hundred dollars.
. (H) And from the time of this first sale,
til May nineteen seventy-eight,
) John was sold,
er half a dozen times,
cause nobody wanted him,
) and nobody could get along with him.
. (H) But in May of nineteen seventy-eight,
New York businessman,
m Rubin,
) decided it would be fun to own a racehorse.
 (H) Well Mister Rubin didn't know anything about horses,
) and the only thing he knew about racing,
 where the valet parking was.
. (H) So he bought John Henry,
er the telephone,
ght unseen,
r twenty-five thousand dollars.
 (H) John then went to New York,
 his first trainer Bobby Donato.
 (H) In his very first New York start,
 won a twenty-five thousand dollar claiming race,
er the dirt,
 one and a half lengths.
 (H) His next race was on turf,
) which John preferred to run on,
d again he won,
t this time by fourteen lengths.
. (H) Well a group of horsemen who knew more about racing than Mister Rubin did,
) advised him to send John west,
 where the turf racing was more lucrative,
re competitive,
d run all year long.
. So in late nineteen seventy-nine,
) John headed west,
 his new trainer,
 Ronald McAnally.
. (H) In nineteen eighty,
hn won over nine-hundred thousand dollars.
 (H) In nineteen eighty-one,
hn won the very first Arlington Million,
) over one point seven million dollars,
d was voted horse of the year.
 (H) In nineteen eighty-two,
d nineteen eighty-three,
hn had some injuries,
d only won four races,
) but they mounted up to one point two million dollars.
. (H) And when Mister McAnally wanted to bring John Henry back as a nine-year-old,
) folks were pretty skeptical about his chances of being competitive at this age.
.. (H) Well John did lose his first race that year,
(H) but he went on to have his best year ever on the racetrack.
... (H) He won six graded stakes,
including a repeat victory in the Arlington Million,
(H) over two point three million dollars,
and again was voted horse of the year.
... (H) When John was retired in nineteen eighty-four,
he was the world's richest thoroughbred in history.

UD:	.. The horses that retire here,
how much exercise,

EBRA:	Okay.
.. These horses are .. are not ridden anymore,
um,
they're just,
@ l- like you said,
they're retired,
(H) they each have their own paddock,
except for Sergeant Pepper and Imperator,
they --
We turn them out together,
because they're friends,
(H) and mostly they just hang out in their paddock,
and they graze and,
(H) they exercise themselves,
they run around a lot,
and keep themselves in shape,
and,
(H) that's about all they @do.
@They @get,
(H) they get lots of treats,
and lots of lo=ve and,
.. s- we think they're happy.
.. But,
(H) they still run around,
um,
just .. like young horses,
sometimes John will get out there and run around,
he'll rear up on his hind legs,
like .. @Silver,
<@ you know and do @> --
(H) And uh it's real cute,
uh Forego'll run around,
(H) Willie,
.. and his little goat will get out there and,
(H) and run and,
.. Imperator usually likes to trot.
He doesn't gallop a lot,
but he trots around like he did when he was showing and,
(H) it's --
.. They're real cute.
... There any other questions?
UD:	... Yes.

.. Uh,
.. the goat .. in with the horse.
Are they just .. good friends?
EBRA:	Uhuh.

(H) He- --
Willie doesn't really like other horses very well.
.. (H) And and he likes people,

(H) we don't want him to get lonely,
<@ and that's his @>,
.. @ that's his little friend @.

... Originally they had got the goat for John Henry,
when he first came to live here,
eight years ago,
(H) and they put the goat in the stall with him,
he kicked it back out,
@@ (H) <@ and um,
(H) @> so Willie adopted it.
@@
And that .. original goat died about a year ago,
and Willie was real sad and depressed,
so they got him a new one.
... (H) Our last horse to come out today,
is our standardbred representative,
Rambling Willie.
.. (H) A standardbred races at a trot or a pace,
and they pull a sulky with a driver.
... (H) Willie is a pacer.
... (H) Willie was born in Monroeville Indiana,
and he began his racing career as a to-year-old,
for his owner Raymond Gibson.
(H) He had four starts with two seconds and two thirds,
(H) so he did show some promise,
but Mister Gibson decided to sell Willie as a three-year-old.
... (H) Willie was sold to a hall of fame trainer and driver,
Mister Robert Farrington,
for fifteen thousand dollars.
(H) But not long after he bought him,
Mister Farrington decided he'd spent too much money on this horse,
(H) so he called a friend of his from Cincinnati Ohio,
Mister Paul Sebert,
(H) and he tried to talk Mister Sebert into buying a half interest in Willie.
... (H) Well Mister Sebert had owned horses before,
(H) and his luck had been pretty bad.
.. (H) The first horse he owned died,
before it made it to the racetrack,
(H) and the second horse he owned made it to the races,
and she ran and ran,
but just couldn't win anything,
so he sold her.
.. (H) And after he sold her,
she went on to win her next four starts in a row for her new owner.
... (H) Well Mister Sebert did buy a half interest in Willie though,
(H) and things didn't start off so well there either.
... Willie was being raced at county fairs,
in Ohio and Indiana,
(H) and was being beaten on a regular basis.
... (H) Well around this time Mister Farrington's wife Vivian was having a birthday,
(H) and he was trying to decide what to get her.
.. (H) So Mister Farrington decided that a good present for Vivian,
would be the other half of Willie.
... (H) Well Vivian was a very religious person,
(H) and her father at that time was the minister of a nearby church.
.. (H) So Vivian decided,
that if Willie ever had any success at the racetrack,
(H) she would donate ten percent,
of her half of Willie's earnings,
to her father's church.
... (H) And that's when Willie's racing career took off.
ANY:	(LAUGHTER)
EBRA:	(H) Because of his success,
and his ties to the church,
.. there was a book written about Willie,
titled,
(H) Rambling Willie,
The Horse That God Loved.
.. (H) In order to promote his book,
.. Willie would hold autograph sessions.
.. (H) One day when Willie was in New York,
he had an autograph session at Macy's department store.
(H) And he was such a hit there,
that Macy's gave him his very own charge card.
ANY:	(LAUGHTER)[=]
EBRA:	[(H) Well Willie] is without a doubt one of the toughest and most durable horses to ever race.
(H) He raced from the age of two to thirteen.
.. He had an incredible three-hundred and five starts.
(H) He won a hundred and twenty-eight times,
(H) sixty-nine times he finished second,
.. and seventy-nine times he paced the mile,
in two minutes or less,
(H) which is a record Willie still holds today.
... When he retired,
he was the richest standardbred in history,
(H) with earnings over two million dollars.
... (H) Willie is our other senior citizen here at the Hall of Champions,
(H) he is twenty-four years old,
and stands fifteen point two hands tall.
(H) Ladies and gentlemen,
the horse that God loved,
.. Rambling Willie.
ANY:	((APPLAUSE))[=]
EBRA:	[.. Now I'll just let everybody know,
that] Willie's book is for sale here at the Horse Park gift shop.
... (H) And we'd like to thank everyone,
for coming to the Horse Park,
and to the Hall of Champions presentation,
(H) we hope you've had a good day,
and if you have any questions,
feel free to ask us on your way out.

... He's reaching for the mat.
... [He's in] there and wi=nds up,
ICK:	[Yeah],
ED:	... he's reaching for the mat,
... with this arm.
.. And your arm's way up here high.
You're like way up high off the ground,
... (H) and your sensei,
(H) is <VOX way= down like this VOX>.
By the time he gets to the end of the throw.
... See the difference?
... So you're wrapping,
(H) and you're thinking,
I gotta make this throw,
what am I gonna do,
... and ... ~Nick,
 (H) is going for the mat with this arm.
He's (H) into a f-,
almost like a forward roll .. mode.
... The other difference that I noticed between you (Hx) and your sensei is that,
... this foot is way= out here.
.. This .. the,
... your,
ICK:	... Are they [trying to throw] over the entire hip se[2ction2]?

he's got the,

(H)
ENTON:	Kay,

if you lift up,
(H) when you lift up to make the springing motion,

you fall this way real quick.

I mean,

ENTON:	.. Ah so.

ICK:	.. Try it again.

you notice the difference in the foot position,
what- hi- --
what --
how much that helped?
ENTON:	.. Mhm,
ICK:	... Step directly between his legs,
with your advancing foot.
... No [no no no no].
ENTON:	[Ah=],
ICK:	You're not,
.. not between his leg[s].
ED:	[Now] reach that arm.
Reach that arm,
ICK:	Shoot it.
ED:	Reach that arm through.
ILL:	.. ((FALL))
ED:	... The more you reach that arm through,
... L- let me add one- --
Let me add one thing to it,
to make it --
cause it is a hard fall if you're,
(H) throwing it contest style,
if you're throwing it demo style,
(H) somebody once told me,
(H) that that,
the way to practice,
(H) a=ll the Makikomi-waza,
... (H) was .. to go down ... like this.
To take this foot if you're throwing right-hand throws,
(H) and to take this foot,
(H) and stick it <VOX a=ll= the way through VOX> l[ike thi]s.
ICK:	[Yep],
ED:	... (H) And just stick it.
... A=ll the way,
(H) behi=nd you,
.. like this.
And as you go down,
... % and you roll like that.
Okay,
(H) and if you do this,
in demo,
.. uh .. in demo fashion,
(H) you'll be so low to the ground,
(H) by the ti=me that your opponent ... hits the ground (Hx),
that you'll be rea=l nice to him.
... A=nd that way I mean (Hx),
(H) you can intensify,
you can always intensify throwing.
((SLAP)) .. throw it harder.
(H)= But the mark of a ... good .. (H) judo throw,
is to be able to (Hx),
do you see the people throw Seoi so nice,
(H) they can do --
they could throw their grandmother,
 and it doesn't even hurt (Hx).
<WH She goes ah=.
That felt good WH>.
... So [you can] do that,
ICK:	[Mm],
ED:	.. (H) by sticking that le=g (Hx),
... all the way through,
<X just X>  like that.
As you get --
.. (H) ... You follow what I'm saying?
ENTON:	... Yes sir,
ICK:	... You don't have to drive em through the mat.
ED:	That,
that's a way that you can (Hx),
practice it over and over (Hx),
in a demo style,
(H) and be so low to the ground (Hx),
that it's a real nice,
(H) it's about as good as you can get a Makikomi for your uke.
... (H) It's really not that bad.
(H) And you could (Hx) --
(H) it's it's (H) --
ICK:	Throw <X him X>,
and .. let him see.
ED:	Alright,
... Alright,
S- so we're coming over like this,

ED:	... alright?
ICK:	Nice easy clean fall.

H:	... Okay.
 Good sized return.
RY:	.. Yeah.
H:	Now you're not looking at % .. adding air conditioning.
 Right?
RY:	Well,
. [we would] like to have that as an option.
H:	    [X]
 [2Okay].
RY:	   [2We could2] always add that later.
ght?
H:	... Yeah.
e of the things you can do,
 .. if you don't wanna do it now,
. you can,
 what they call,
 prep for air conditioning.
u can put in the coil.
. See you've [got the] furnace and the coil,
RY:	               [<X Yeah X>].
H:	(H) and then,
. when you add air conditioning in the future,
. all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit,
. and refrigerant piping to that coil.
. So it .. saves --
 it saves= additional work in the future.
RY:	... Mhm.
H:	Otherwise you gotta come back and put the coil in,
ich means you gotta modify the duct work,
 [get that] coil in there so,
RY:	   [Right].
H:	.. (H) if you're thinking about doing it in the future,
u might wanna at least put the coil in.
 only .. costs about three-hundred fifty dollars for the coil.
RY:	Oh.
 Alright.
H:	.. It's the it's the out[door air conditioning <X that X>] --
RY:	                        [Well,
 write that in] there,
yway in the .. in the quote.
H:	... (TSK) And now that's the .. the dining room you wanna add?
RY:	Yeah.
 you --
 you go over and have a look at the dining room,
H:	You got a lotta glass in that room it looks like.
RY:	yeah,
 and % we're gonna be making changes to the ... to the house too,
 we're .. keeping that in mind.
t if you notice,
ere are no registers in here.
. So,
H:	.. (H) Is this accessible?
RY:	... oh yeah].
H:	    [I wonder] --
wonder if,
 [was this] added on you think,
RY:	   [(SNIFF)]
H:	.. maybe?
. I'm just wondering if that [2foun2]dation wall &
RY:	                               [2M-2] --
. It might've been.
H:	& goes to that,
 I wonder if I can get .. into this.
RY:	Oh you can get into it.
ah.
H:	.. [Okay].
RY:	   [Oh yeah].
ve been under here.
H:	.. Oh okay.
 [Good].
RY:	   [So],
is is not a problem.
H:	.. Shoot I'd probab[ly go] with two registers in this room.
RY:	                   [X] --
 Alright.
] --
H:	[I'd] probably go like [2one here2], 
RY:	                       [2<X Oh yeah X>2],
H:	and one .. [3one there3].
RY:	           [3you'd do one3] over there as well?
H:	... Cause it's a good-sized room with a lot of glass.
RY:	... Okay.
H:	.. Or you could do it,
. you know,
u could put like one on this wall,
d one on that wall.
RY:	.. Okay,
 the two .. two out[side- --
H:	                     [And then I'd] probably tie em both together,
RY:	Yeah].
H:	... into one Y-branch,
 you know like the room,
RY:	... Mhm.
H:	... the room is shaped somewhat like this.
. <X I could X> put like one there,
. one there,
RY:	Now what we'd want you to do,
 this case,
 maybe --
H:	.. tie those together like that.
RY:	.. See this this --
e end of this room might be modified.
. So,
. all we wanna know is,
. is that we can eventually be able to do this.
. Alright.
. To to get % .. get this= ... duct work done,
en we do --
en we do the modification to [the] --
H:	                               [Oh],
 you may not do the duct work at this point?
RY:	[Not .. not in this room.
H:	[X .. XX .. do it in the future].
RY:	We m-] --
 Yeah.
 [Uh I I hate] to see us do it,
H:	   [<X Where are gonna be your X>] --
RY:	(H) although if we do it in the [2sidewalls2],
H:	[2Well what would 2] the modification be.
RY:	... Oh we might take this out,
 and we might push this out further,
d,
 uh,
 well,
re's the drawings,
ght here.
. <0h=,                
. <P let's see=,
 that's the guest house.
. Where is that sucker P>%>.
H:	... Dining room?
RY:	... (TSK) (H) Yeah.
 Yeah,
--
's right --
 --
 here [it i- here it i-] here it is right here,
H:	        [Is this the wall],
RY:	you can see that --
) this is the current [wall],
H:	                        [oh] okay,
 are you gonna go out [2like .. three feet or so2],
RY:	                        [2So we might --
 we might2] --
 we might %= .. [3do a little modification.
H:	                  [3a tape- .. tapered uh .. corners3].
RY:	.. A tapered3] corner there.
) So we might do .. a little .. of that.
H:	.. Okay.
RY:	But,
 if you're gonna ... put it in h- .. this end wall,
en,
 maybe it wouldn't be affected.
. That one might down there.
 Because,
 might uh,
H:	... [Yeah],
RY:	    [XX]
H:	see well,
RY:	.. (H) See [eventually <X we have s- X>] --
H:	           [you know you're right.
 Cause I] --
 cause we're looking at right there,
. course,
 now you gonna go out --
RY:	.. That's right.
e we're opening this,
H:	That's [gonna go that way].
RY:	       [that --
 <X it's X>] --
 that that that's going out to this master,
 which is gonna go up on the hill.
H:	... Aw,
 you'll need --
 What about .. heating for that.
RY:	.. Well,
 what we're gonna do is put uh .. radiated heat.
H:	.. Okay.
RY:	In- in there.
H:	.. [That'll be a slab] floor then.
RY:	   [For sure].
ah,
ah.
 (H) [Uh],
H:	    [So that] one might change,
RY:	... (H) [2Yeah2].
H:	        [2uh=2],
RY:	.. I- that's a that's a good point.
ve .. I I'm not .. uh,
. we were th- --
H:	... The only thing i=s,
 I don't know how long,
 that gonna be like ... in the future,
ke a year down the road?
RY:	... Yeah.
 [Probably].
H:	   [Cause it] would be nice to have heat in here (H) in the meantime.
. I mean say you do the furnace,
. It would be nice to have it .. for this winter.
RY:	Well let me work that out with my wife.
. Put that as a --
H:	.. But one thing you can do,
en if you do a modification,
u can move the register.
. I mean say we put the register right ... h=ere,
 and that's gonna b- --
 that would obviously have to be moved,
. you know,
's not a [big deal] to move it from here to here.
RY:	           [Yeah].
H:	You might have to add a piece of duct work,
) but it's not gonna be a major change,
RY:	Okay.
. Okay.
H:	... And this one you may not have to move at all.
at may be okay.
RY:	... Alright.
H:	... But then that's probably how I'd do it,
me- .. something like that,
,
 I had the registers .. going that way,
. that might be the best way to do it.
. It'd be like for- fourteen by six,
RY:	... (SNIFF) (SNIFF) (SNIFF)
H:	 I mean that would probably be an eight-inch duct,
at'd be an eight-inch,
at'd be a ten-inch,
. and then the furnace,
don't know,
's somewhere over there (Hx) [in that area],
RY:	                               [Furnace=] .. [2is=2] --
H:	[2I'm not sure how many feet2],
RY:	Well the furnace sits down,
 over in this,
. this corner over here.
. That's where the furnace is.
H:	... One.
. Two.
RY:	.. Probab[ly] right ... in here.
H:	         [Three].
RY:	... And now --
at's probably what- --
at's one of the &
H:	That's about [thirty] --
RY:	& key]
 key [2concerns2],
H:	       [2about thirty-six2] feet across.
RY:	is th- .. is the how noisy the furnace is.
. That's a real concern to me.
. A=nd uh,
don't know what they've got these days,
 if they're all --
 %= I know there's pulse type furnaces,
ich evidently are kinda lou=d or something,
H:	Oh yeah.
. Yeah.
nnox pulse.

RY:	oh [@really]?
H:	   [(H)] That's a loud one.
RY:	Is it?
H:	(H) [Yeah],
RY:	    [<X Really X>].
H:	I've put a few of those in,
nd they],
RY:	[<X Have you X>].
H:	(H) .. I've had problems.
wouldn't go with the Lennox pulse.
RY:	Okay.
H:	... If I go [with a=] uh,
RY:	            [Well],
H:	I'd probably go with the Carrier.
. Carrier furnace.
) The return grill's plenty big enough.
RY:	.. yeah.
's a big [return,
H:	           [I mean I can't --
u can't] have any kind of problem [2there2],
RY:	and a] --
and2] and the pipes are big enough,
=,
d that's normally when you get --
 you get .. a lot of noise .. in the house.
) Is if your= --
. if your uh ... ducts are too small.
ght?
H:	Right.
 (H) Yeah,
 the two main sources of noise,
 are either,
. uh=,
. air noise,
 which is due to undersized grills,
RY:	Really?
H:	you got air rushing through there at high velocity.
) The other source of noise is th- .. is the fan motor itself.
)
RY:	In the- in the actual --
H:	.. In the .. unit itself.
RY:	Unhunh.
H:	And that's usually solved by b-,
st having flexible duct between the unit .. and the d- and the registers,
 that it dampens out the noise.
) In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall=,
) it would be noisy.
RY:	.. Yeah.
H:	But we're going d- --
m not sure how it .. connects,
. did we see that down there?
. I'll have to go down and take a look at that again [but,
RY:	                                                       [Okay].
H:	(H)] I imagine it goes dow=n,
 (H) and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit.
 long as I can get say ten feet or so between that and the unit,
 (H) [then I] --
RY:	       [You can].
H:	.. then I can= uh ... eliminate th- .. the noise problem.
RY:	.. Alright.
H:	... So it's basically thirty by thirty,
. return air.
. Thirty by thirty return air.
RY:	... And this is a uh=,
is is the only return,
d I'd= --
would [say not -- 
H:	        [Oh this is return also]?
RY:	.. not placed],
 not placed very well,
 the room.
H:	... [This is] --
RY:	    [So],
H:	this is supply though.
ght?
RY:	... this is the supply.
ght.
H:	Okay.
. (H) Yeah.
RY:	.. See,
d I'd (Hx) --
 Where would you suggest .. they would go.
 uh,
 if we put uh,
H:	... Boy.
 I would say g-,
d probably go with two.
. I'd put one on each side,
d probably put one like right underneath that window there,
. and maybe underneath that window.
. Be nice to put it behind the couch,
t then you've --
 would be blocked off too much.
RY:	... And you thi- --
u so you .. you p- you try and put em= under windows,
ere .. that's where [your] --
H:	                      [(Hx)] .. Yeah.
try to [put em] on= .. the cold- --
RY:	         [X] --
H:	basically the coldest part of the room (Hx).
RY:	Okay.
H:	... (TSK) Because uh,
. it just helps,
= .. because otherwise,
ou know,
th a grill right here,
) .. you end up having cold spots on the sides.
RY:	Mhm.
H:	Cause what happens is,
e air goes b=ack to the return grill,
) [so it never really,
RY:	    [<X It wouldn't get X> out circulating through] --
H:	it never really blows] out .. to the corners.
RY:	[2Right].
H:	[2So that's why I2] try to put it .. as far away (H) on the perimeter,
d have it pull across the room.
RY:	... Okay.
ll this is the on[ly --
H:	                   [So I don't know if you'd wanna] --
RY:	.. % the only the only] other addition room,
ere we thought maybe registers would be important.
. And I'd,
 I don't know if,
. uh=,
. floor registers?
e there --
e- th- i- i- i- is- d- does it --
 that's not a good idea these days?
H:	... No,
 would go with floor registers in this house,
use you got high ceilings.
RY:	.. % [XX]
H:	     [Well in fact],
u wouldn't be able to (H) put any kind of ceiling register in.
. Cause you get the second floor.
RY:	Right.
H:	... So,
.
oor registers are fine,
r heating.
RY:	... But th- --
u're talking about wa=ll regis- --
 putting em in the wall here.
H:	... No,
was- I was thinking about putting em in the floor.
RY:	Oh in the floor?
H:	.. Yeah to- --
. to go in the wa=ll,
uld be .. pretty tough.
RY:	Okay.
. Alright.
H:	I don't know if you wanna cut the floor though.
RY:	... Yeah.
 Well I hate to do it right there.
y- maybe we'd do it right in here.
H:	... Yeah.
. But to get in the wall [would be] almost --
RY:	                           [X]
H:	... I mean you can do that during new construction,
t it's tough .. when you're coming back after the fact,
use <X you= just X> got,
)
RY:	Sure.
H:	your- your two-by-four framing,
. and it's just too tough to get in there.
RY:	... Okay.
. Alright.
 we'd put a couple in this room somewhere?
. [And then uh],
H:	    [So this is like] a= family room?
 that what this is?
RY:	.. Uh=,
's kinda like a lo- --
nda a little ... parlor,
brary,
mething,

ETH:	... Alright.
ARRY:	... XXX,
... XXXX.
... This is a register,
so that's okay.

ETH:	.. Okay.
ARRY:	.. the bathroom has a register,
... (H) now that was it.
.. [XXX]
ETH:	   [How about] the uh thermostat.
ARRY:	... This guy?
ETH:	... Okay.
.. I would definitely go with a new thermostat.
ARRY:	... Yeah.
... Kind of a [.. X antique,
ETH:	              [But that's probably a good --

ETH:	Yeah,
that should be in a museum.
ARRY:	... @@@@@

ETH:	.. well,
.. I guess you [haven't really] --

you haven't .. r- really lived in the house .. during the winter.
Have you?
ARRY:	No.

[(H) And that's what we th- --
ETH:	[So you don't really know=,
if there's a] --
ARRY:	See and that's what] we thought we would do,
uh (Hx),

ARRY:	.. That's right.
... [so <X I sa- X>] --
ETH:	    [So we don't know] if there's any particular areas,

ARRY:	@ [<@ Do you think it's pretty] cool in there @>?
ETH:	  [Just .. that one grill].
ARRY:	(H) And then this guy has a ... register,
so,
ETH:	Oh they got AC up here too.
ARRY:	... yeah.
.. I n- I think that's gonna go.
ETH:	... Well uh,
.. [especially if] you get the forced air [2(H)2] heating and cooling,

ARRY:	.. One little guy there.
ETH:	.. Yeah see these aren't ... strategically placed either,
but you've .. pretty much got no choice.
.. (H) ... On most of these,
these --
it's almost impossible to ... to change these now,
... but really on the second floor,
ARRY:	... This one's [not too bad].
ETH:	               [(H)] the heat .. the heat's gonna rise,
.. from the first floor anyway.
ARRY:	Yeah up to- --
You [know.
ETH:	    [So= I] -- 
ARRY:	And it'll] hold it in here real [2well2].

.. Typically,
and- if anything you have 0verheating problems.
ARRY:	.. Mm.
[Yeah.
ETH:	[On the second floor].
ARRY:	(H) Well] see that's what we wanted to do,
is have some kind of a system,
that we know we can shut off.
... Certain .. certain areas.
Like if w- --
ETH:	.. One of the things we could do,
I don't think they have any dampers here.
Do they?
.. (H) ... Oh they do.
ARRY:	... (H) Yeah.
ETH:	... [So you can close off] --
ARRY:	    [Oh okay.
.. <X So that's] how it's X> --
ETH:	... Yeah you can close off [2.. individual d-2] --
ARRY:	                           [2Close these off2],
ETH:	... [3(H)3]
ARRY:	    [3and then the-3] --
.. then it'll force the air what.
.. Down into --
ETH:	... (H) Downstairs.
[Now,
ARRY:	[X]
ETH:	the] one thing you don't wanna do though,
is close off= .. too many of em.
ARRY:	... [Cause then you put a strain on the]= --
ETH:	    [Cause .. cause then you're uh=] --
.. yeah,
you've gotta have a certain amount of air,
(H) for the furnace to work properly.
... And if you reduce the airflow too much,
.. (H) then it won't have enough air going across .. the heat exchanger,
and it'll --
.. it'll overheat the heat exchanger.
ARRY:	Oh.
.. Really?
.. Okay.
ETH:	... So I would say,
ENV:	((RADIO_BECOMES_AUDIBLE))
ETH:	you don't want to close more than uh,
... more than about twenty-five percent of em.
... Or you can close em,
%y= you know,
if you close em uh %a=- a hundred percent.
If you close em all the way,
... you probably don't want to shut more than (hx) twenty-five percent of em.
All the way.
ARRY:	... (Hx)=
ETH:	... Which would b- --
.. I'm not sure,
(H) maybe all upstairs,
... (H) you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit [though.
ARRY:	[Unhunh]?
ETH:	Just] to make sure you get enough air,
ARRY:	Yeah.
ETH:	... (H) But,
okay,
so we'd be looking at adding two,
... two registers for that .. parlor room?
ARRY:	... Adding two to that [parlor room],
ETH:	                       [And then what about that one].
Do you wanna hold off on that?
ARRY:	Well,
maybe we should jus=t --
ETH:	... Or would you wanna do at least one of em?
ARRY:	... (TSK) %= I think we should do something,
yeah.
Only because --
ETH:	.. Because if that [.. remodel's a year away then],
ARRY:	                   [I I th- --
<X I guess I th- X> --
I think] this thing is gonna be a cold little --
ETH:	.. oh,
I can def[initely @see that @@].
ARRY:	         [I.. I I can tell you] that,
because the windows,
ETH:	.. See you only <X like X> -- 
.. the only heat you have in this room,
is that .. one register over there.
ARRY:	.. the windows in this thing are <<THUMP ++ just a+bout +ready +to ++fall out.
+ I +mean +they're THUMP>> --
.. they're not --
.. Look at this.
... So I know there's gonna be a lot of uh --
ETH:	... A lotta infiltration.
ARRY:	Yeah.
Until we get this corrected.
ETH:	... See hopefully you'll go with double-pane glass on your remodel.
ARRY:	... X[XX]	
ETH:	     [That'll help] cut down a lot.
ARRY:	Yeah.
ETH:	On your &
ARRY:	        [Yeah].
ETH:	& heat loss.
ARRY:	... So,
.. I mean,
.. %= in some ways,
having windows,
.. is it a bad idea?
Because you get a lot of natural .. heat from the the s- from sun.
ETH:	.. [That's right].
ARRY:	   [<X You knowX>].
ETH:	.. Okay this is like it would [2get2] --
ARRY:	                              [2So2],
ETH:	This is like east facing.
Right?
(H)
ARRY:	Yeah.
The [s- in in] --
ETH:	    [So you get some morning] sun.
ARRY:	You get the morning,
in the winter,
it's gonna come right across like [this].
ETH:	                                  [Yeah].
ARRY:	So,
[XX]
ETH:	[So that's gonna be] good.
ARRY:	So that'll be good.
So maybe one register in here for the moment,
.. until we kinda feel it out [would be= uh],
ETH:	                              [(SNIFF) .. Sure].
.. I mean this one it looks like,
.. if we put a register over here,
(H) .. you wouldn't have to change it anyway.
ARRY:	... Yeah.
.. No that .. [that] --
ETH:	              [With your] remodel,
that might .. work into it.
ARRY:	.. Yeah.
ETH:	.. And like I say,
even i- --
even if you do have to move it,
.. (H) it's not X a big deal.
... I mean [somebody] ... just moves it,
ARRY:	           [Okay].
ETH:	.. you know,
a carpenter can do it even.
You don't even need to have us come out and do it really.
... You might have to add a- --
.. buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there,
but [it's not a] --
ARRY:	    [Yeah].
ETH:	... not a big deal.
ARRY:	.. Okay.
... Alright.
ETH:	... Okay?
ARRY:	Well that sounds good.
ETH:	Well let me check .. downstairs again,
I gotta take some measurements on that [room].
ARRY:	                                       [O]kay.
.. Well now you get --
you've got the logistics of every- --
Oh= wait.
.. [<X And then I think X>] my wife,
ETH:	   [Now  you --

ARRY:	Okay.

ETH:	        [(SNIFF)]
... Yeah.
.. Cause we can do em now,
or we can do em later.
... But it's not ... any more difficult ... to do em .. at a later time.
... So it's not like you ha=ve to do it now.
ARRY:	Okay.
ETH:	... So the registers that we're connecting to,
that are existing,
how many of those we have got.
We've got the one in the kitchen,
... and then we've got= uh,
one in the d- .. living room here,
ARRY:	... That guy,

So,
ARRY:	... Oh that's right.

.. Oh ok[3ay3].
	         [3So=3] .. u=m,
ne of my thoughts is=,
that .. u=m,
(TSK) .. well,
I want a tape deck .. that's gonna sound about,
you know,
ood as it ca=n,
	[Okay],

	                  [Sure].

I wonder if you would .. suggest that this .. Luxman ... is the- --

	                                  [%]
U=m,
(TSK) ... the uh= --

f the double cassette deck,
just purely for= ... (H) taping from one tape to the other?
[That's its main purpose].
n fact I wouldn't know what other purpose it .. %_would [ha=ve].
	[Oh] okay.
other benefit is=,
s if,
H) you can load up two tapes in it,
like,
s say two ninety minute tapes [of music].
:	                                  [Unhunh],
2I see2].
	   [2(H)2] And you can set a switch on [3it3],

	... [4where4] it will continually play,
:	    [4Okay4].
Okay.
	... all four sides,

:	[I see].
That's probably not gonna hap[2pen.
	                                 [2Okay2].
:	No2].
t's mainly for copying.
	... (TSK) [Okay].
:	          [So],
	.. And the tapes you'd be copyi=ng,
uh=,
are they gonna be straight music?
:	... M=mostly.
	.. Okay.
:	Yeah.
	... Okay.
:	[Yeah].
	[So] you are gonna want,
(H) or desire a pretty .. d=ecent=,
uh,
copy of your original [tape].
:	                          [Mhm],
[2right2].
	    [2Okay2].
(H) U=m,

 you know,
MY:	.. [Mhm],
D:	   [as] perfect [2as2].

D:	.. or even as that tape was.
MY:	.. [mhm],
D:	   [There is] gonna be some loss=,
MY:	... mhm,
D:	.. in the generation of= [making] that copy.
MY:	                         [mhm],
 [2(TSK)
D:	   [2(H=) And2] --
MY:	Is there2] a way to avoid that loss=?
mean how --
D:	... (TSK)
MY:	... [X] --
D:	    [Well],
 you're you're gonna have that loss,
 j=ust .. (H) ... because of all the different things involved,
MY:	..[Right].
D:	  [f=-] from,
 taking it from one tape,
 and putting [it on] the other tape.
MY:	               [Right].
ght.
D:	There's a lot of things in the signal path [there].
MY:	                                           [Right].
D:	(H)
MY:	So you're .. you're b=ound to lose something.
D:	... Yeah.
 [It's not huge],
MY:	   [No matter what].
D:	you know,
t may be] ten perc=e=nt,
MY:	[Okay].
D:	or=,

MY:	[Right].
D:	or [2something2] like that.
MY:	   [2Right2].

D:	    [3(H)3] .. Uh which is a small amount,

 mhm,
 okay2].
D:	[3S=o3],
MY:	[3Okay3].
D:	I don't see a problem in that.
 (H) U=m,
 the other thing I realize is,
) ... uh=,
. think about how much of the time you're gonna be doing that.
MY:	... [Mhm],
D:	    [Because] of- --
 You are paying a decent premium,
 to [have] that conve[2nience2].
MY:	      [mhm],
                     [2mhm2],
. mhm,

MY:	    [Okay].
. [2Okay.
D:	    [2(H) Okay2],
MY:	Right2].
D:	that would be your first level.

MY:	.. Okay.
D:	... A=nd,
ith the unit you already have,

MY:	(TSK) [Right].
D:	      [(H)] all the units=,

D:	.. and=,
 u=m,
. (TSK) as far as the remote control funtions go.

D:	(H) The decks [5come with5],
MY:	              [5(THROAT)5]
D:	.. what's called a DIN cable,

MY:	             [Mhm],
 [2right2].
D:	   [2(H)2] okay this is the kay one eleven.
MY:	... Okay.
D:	... (TSK) This would be,
guess you'd say the entry level,
MY:	.. [Right],
D:	   [(H)] to integrate into your system.
MY:	.. [2okay2].
D:	   [2(H=)2] U=m,
 (TSK) .. this gives you,
. a lot of pluses that,
 most people's basic decks don't have.
MY:	[Hm].
D:	[(H)] Okay=,
 has Dolby,
MY:	... [Mhm],
D:	    [which] as you know,
at's a circuit to cut the tap=e hiss,
 [(H)] without cutting the high frequencies.
MY:	   [right].
. [2Right2].
D:	    [2(H)2] And u=m,
 % r=egular Dolby is Dolby B.

D:	you're gonna wanna record it in Dolby C.
MY:	[mhm],
D:	[That's] gonna sound sonically super[2ior2].
MY:	                                    [2mhm2],
D:	(H) .. U=m,

MY:	           [Mhm],
D:	... (H) u=m,

                                         [3o3]kay.
D:	(H) The other thing about it is,
u can flip the tape over at any point ... in [the middle].
MY:	                                               [Mhm],

D:	.. put it on continuous auto [2reverse,

mhm4],
D:	[4(H) (TSK)4] Now=,
. the=,

 (H) that Luxman offers,

D:	... [3Or high speed dubbing3].
MY:	    [3Hm.

D:	[(H)] To make your copy.
MY:	... [2Mhm2],
D:	    [2(H)2] And it will continue making the copy,
u know,
om side A then,
d it'll flip over,

MY:	      [mhm],
D:	(H) u=m,

MY:	    [Hm].
D:	(TSK) because it has three heads.

 that it has a separate head for record,

(H) she didn't want .. to keep the mare at home,

ARY:	[Yeah]=.
ULIE:	... Well [2these are2] --
ARY:	[2So what did2] you do to your arena.
ULIE:	... (H) U=m,
... well last year I put in a whole new ring.
I spent about three thousand dollars leveling it?
Because it wasn't quite level,
I --
.. I'd had it ... leveled when I moved here,
but it w- .. really wasn't level?
ARY:	[Mhm]?
ULIE:	[(H)] And the sand that I had in it .. % --
There was natural sand in it when I bought the place,
(H) It had all washed down the road,
and I p- think Kettle Creek scooped it up and put it in their ring,
(H)[= So=] it was hard .. as a rock.
ARY:	[<WH @= @@ WH>]
ULIE:	And it kept washing out.
And it was terrible and,
.. like riding on asphalt.
So (Hx),
I had,
ARY:	... Well you were probably down to the hardpack.
ULIE:	... I was down to clay.
ARY:	[Mm=].
ULIE:	[(H)] An=d I had Havens come out,
and --
with a bulldozer.
And he leveled the whole thing,
he took a who=le bunch out of this corner you can see,
ARY:	[Yeah.
ULIE:	[(H) And p]ut it down in that corner.
ARY:	.. Yeah].
ULIE:	(H) A=nd,
it just ... was a lot nicer.
And then I had,
... three-hundred tons of sand brought in and @spread.
ARY:	[(WHISTLE)]
ULIE:	[(H)] It was great in the winter time?
When it was all frozen,
and I had this much soft stuff on top?
(H) but when it thawed,
(H) we couldn't ride in it,
it was this deep.
ARY:	Oh=.
ULIE:	It was ho=rrid.
And [the horses have had a] hard time.
ARY:	[Too much],
ULIE:	(H) So today --
Finally it's been dry enough for Tad to come out and,
... and take the rest of the sand off.
And I sold [it to him],
ARY:	[Oh he was t]aking it [2ou=t2].
ULIE:	[2(H)2] He was [3taking it ou=t3].
ARY:	[3Oh okay,
I saw the big3] d=ump[4truck4].

[who put in a ring] but didn't have any sand y[2et.
ARY:	[Okay].
[2O=kay2].
ULIE:	(H) So2] she got a great deal.
She got about a third of my sand,
(H) that I paid (Hx),
twelve or thirteen-hundred dollars for delivered,
(H) and she got it a-,
got about a third of it,
for about two-hundred and fifty bucks.
ARY:	Hey= that's good.
ULIE:	... And so it was a lot cheaper [than if she'd] bought it,
ARY:	[Yeah].
ULIE:	cause I only charged her,
(H) a buck (Hx),
... a buck a ton,
which is what I paid for it.
But then I had to pay a lot more to have it hauled in.
ARY:	.. [Yeah].
ULIE:	[(H)] The hauling is what costs so much.
... [2<X But I'll sh- X>2] --
ARY:	[2So uh2]=,
... yeah,
you know,
... My,
my arena isn't very .. level.
ULIE:	... (H) Well it cost her a lot less to level hers,

if he's (Hx),

we'll put him down in the fall (Hx).
I'm not gonna let him wander around blind (Hx).

He was,

He made a sharp turn?
... On the hill,

.. The only injury he had,
And part of the time the shafts,
and it's a metal cart,
.. the shaft was under his belly,

[he's gonna] tea=r himself apart.
ARY:	[Mm].
ULIE:	No=t a mark on his hind legs.
(H) He had a puncture wound on the back of his forearm here,
... Small ... tiny ... puncture wound.

ARY:	[Mm],
ULIE:	(H) A=nd um,

He came out about an @hour @la@ter,

Which was ... the b- rest of the hunt season.

One= large loan (Hx),

... a hundred ninety-seven= .. thousand,
a hundred eighty dollars.
	... It's on ~Gerald and ~Pamela.

 	... (TSK) (H) First ... loan request I have,
 	is= an existing real estate mortgage,

 	.. (H) Customer is ~Gerry and ~Pamela Tucker,
 	(H) .. at sixty-one fifty-eight ~Main Street,
 	in ~Hillsdale Illinois,
 	(H) they're requesting eighty-four thousand dollars,
 	on a thirty-year Fannie Mae fixed rate loan,
 	... (H) this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal,
 	.. title work,
 	.. and points.
 	.. [Eighty-four]?
 	   [(H)] ... Eighty four even.
 	.. (THROAT)
 	.. Their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance,
 	(H) would be seven sixty-one eighty-nine,
 	.. based at the current thirty-year rate.
 	.. (H) .. They estimate the value of their home to be (Hx),
 	one-hundred (Hx) and ten .. thousand dollars.
 	.. (H) .. We had an appraisal in nineteen ninety-one,
 	by a certified appraiser,
 	.. that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars.
 	(H) Eighty percent of that would make it .. eighty-two four.
 	So,
 	(H) .. u=m,
 	... in order to make them a loan for eighty-four thousand,
 	it m=ust appraise for a hundred and five.
 	So that will be,
 	(THROAT)
 	(H) will determine whether or not we can go the full eighty-four,
 	.. and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket.
  	... Their assets total one sixteen four seventeen,
   	(H) .. their= liabilities (Hx) eighty .. -three,
   	.. (H) .. their= .. net worth .. thirty-one.
   	.. [So all they] owe is the house?

   	Mhm.
   	.. (H) They um,
   	... [(TSK)]
   	    [T T] T.
   	currently have a debt to income of twenty-eight over twenty-seven,

   	... What is acceptable pretty much,

   	[.. what figures].
   	[(TSK) (H) Twenty-eight over] thirty-six is the maxe[2s2].
   	[2I2]t's [3as high as it could go?
   	         [3See,

   	Yeah.
   	(H) [Um],
   	    [So you said they're] gonna be .. fifteen?
   	.. Mhm.
   	.. Fifteen over twenty-three so,
   	(H) their debt to income (THROAT) isn't a problem,
   	.. the,
   	(H) uh=,
   	.. problem as I see it is,
   	.. the value of the house,
   	number one,
   	.. (H) and the second (Hx) matter at hand is,
   	that,
   	.. in nineteen eighty-seven,
   	.. (H) they had filed a chapter eleven.
   	(H) They had at the time a mortgage with us,
   	(H) They reaffirmed on that mortgage,
   	.. They were never late,
   	(H) .. We= (Hx),
   	uh,
   	... After that .. discharge,
   	we even advanced them (H) money to purchase this house,
   	on ~Main st- (H) Street here in ~Hillsdale,
   	and um,
   	... (TSK) they have never missed a payment on that loan,
   	(H) .. I've also made them car loans,
   	that they've never missed a payment on (Hx),
   	a=nd um,
   	(TSK) according to Fannie Mae guidelines,
   	as long as they have (H) been discharged,
   	.. at least two years,
   	(H) and ... reestablished and paid as agreed,
   	(H) their credit obligations,
   	they would qualify for a Fannie Mae mortgage.
   	... (H) With that in mind (Hx),
   	.. u=m,
   	... (H) I am moving,
   	that they app- --
   	.. uh,
   	that we approve this loan request,
   	subject to (H) a uh= .. certified appraisal of their home.
   	... Do we have the discharge?
   	.. Yes=.

   	... November,

   	... Two twenty-three eighty-eight.
   	... Discharge date was two twenty-three of eighty-eight.
   	.. When did they file.
   	Didn't you say they filed in [eighty-seven]?
   	                             [Eleven of eighty]-seven.
   	... In eleven?
   	... Mhm.
   	... Three months?
   	Whew.
   	... That's pretty fast.
   	[Yeah.
   	[What did they do.
   	(H)]
   	Dis]miss it?
   	It was a business --
   	.. No,
   	it was a business,
   	uh,
   	bankruptcy,
   	and,
   	(H) it was pretty cut and dried,
   	they jus=t were eliminating the business=,
   	um,
   	.. debt,
   	(H) and apparently nobody objected to the,
   	.. the bankruptcy.
   	... Since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors.
   	(H) All the debt that was= .. charged- --
   	that was bank- .. filed bankruptcy against was (H) unsecured creditors.
   	... And they discharged em,
   	before they even performed,
   	or anything?
   	... (TSK) Yeah,
   	in a three mon- --
   	I guess so,
   	in a p- three-month period of time,
   	cause here's the,
   	... No I --
   	... I just,
   	.. it's unusual that they don't require em to --
   	you know,
   	usually they put em on a two-year or three-year plan or some[thing],

   	... (H) See,
   	the- from what I % I gathered is the,
   	.. unsecured creditors got nothing,
   	.. (H) and the secured creditors,
   	.. just carried on their payment history as agreed.
   	... As originally set forth in their contracts.
   	... <X But you know X> usually the plan'll [provide some period] of time of protection.
   	                                           [Oh I --

   	... Yeah.
   	Okay.
   	... Well,
   	[in that case],

   	and then they came back in and told him he couldn't open.
   	.. Cause there was articles in the paper,
   	and they showed kids at the daycare and,
   	.. he had his ads out and everything,
   	(H) but he didn't have all the i's dotted and t's crossed,
   	and state came back in and said,
   	we=ll,
   	no,
   	you can't really do that.
   	... So=,
   	(H) one group of state people,
   	the people that do all the --
   	... do the testing for=,
   	.. electrical and safety and stuff have been there,
   	and now the state (H) inspector's got to come in,
   	I guess they just .. look at .. the quality of the facility.
   	.. Not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating,
   	but,
   	(H) is it clean,
   	and is it safe,
   	and that sort of thing.
   	.. (H) They're supposed to be there the fifth,
   	.. and he said,
   	that the lady told him,
   	that it usually takes ... a week,
   	... for them to send a report in,
   	and .. for their license to come back.
   	... (H) So,
   	... he anticipates that they'll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth,
   	(H) he gave me some numbers,
   	I can't remember,
   	they've got like,
   	(H) thirteen or fourteen kids they're already taking care of,
   	.. mostly out of their house,
   	until they can get em moved down there,
   	and then they've got eight or nine more.
   	(H) So they fully expect income .. to exceed the projection,
   	.. but right now they don't have any income,
   	other than from .. his job.
   	So,
   	(H) uh=,
   	... [XXX]
   	    [That's fairly] large scale.
   	... What --
   	.. [And he's gonna have twenty]-five people,
   	   [(TSK) (H) The building is] --
   	or [2something2]?
   	   [2Yeah2].
   	... [3At l3] [4east twenty4]-five [5..5] children.
   	    [3Yeah3].
   	                 [4Twenty-five4] --
   	                                 [5See they're e-5] --
   	Yeah.
   	They're expecting that many f=airly quickly.
   	And then,
   	he hopes to get up .. around fifty.
   	... See they're looking at four people,
   	plus=,
   	... (H) [I've gone through the build]ing,
   	        [you know,
   	plus his wife].
   	.. and it is= uh,
   	... a r- very .. very nicely done .. operation.
   	I mean there's nothing (H) .. shoddy about the workmanship,
   	or the quality of the material,
   	or (H) the cleanliness of the,
   	.. of the building.
   	[XX]
   	[Is it at]tached onto a storage facility?
   	(H) No.
   	It's [a separate building].
   	     [Oh it's free-standing] building.
   	[2Yeah2].
   	[2Separate2] building.
   	[3See it's a3],
   	[3They3] --
   	It's a building his dad had,
   	.. where he was --
   	.. where he had his &
   	.. his cabinet sh[op].
   	               [O][2kay.
   	& [2shop,
   	and2],
   	Okay2].
   	.. And was living in it,
   	and they converted the living quarters and all that into this thing.
   	(H) It's like anything,
   	when you're dealing with th- --
   	... you know,
   	regulators and the state,
   	.. they,
   	(H) you know,
   	he said they got two ladies for nine counties,
   	and they --
   	.. There's a lot of this going on,
   	and they can only get to so many.
   	So,
   	(H) I would mo=ve,
   	... since it's secured for forty-five hundred,
   	it's on a twelve-month repayment,
   	which is relatively short,
   	(H) I would move that we ... advance the funds.
   	.. I'll second it.
   	... Except,
   	... they owe pretty much,
   	don't they?
   	.. Three-hundred three thousand,
   	... and some odd dollars.
   	... But he's always serviced,
   	.. I mean,
   	he's never been late,
   	he's always paid as agreed,
   	(H) uh,
   	... and they do have ... the income,
   	it just,
   	right now,
   	the income doesn't --
   	... Well,
   	... I say they have it.
   	(H) O=nce the daycare gets up to twenty people,
   	they'll have enough [inc]ome to,
   	                    [Mhm].
   	(H) They'll fall back under the forty percent,
   	But right now they're over the forty,
   	because we st- can't show any income from the daycare.
   	... (H) Um,
   	... but,
   	... you know,
   	it it --
   	... you know,
   	I feel comfortable that it's there,
   	and like I say,
   	he's always serviced debt as agreed,
   	and,
   	... and his overall debt .. is working down,
   	it's just quite a bit of debt.
   	(H) You just,
   	I guess you can't say too much if they're (H) paying on time.
   	Uh uh,
   	... Yeah.
   	.. and,
   	.. And I think they're about [to the point] --
   	                             [as long as everything] works out good,
   	(H)
   	(H)[=]
   	   [Yeah],
   	I think if th- --
   	you know,
   	th- th- --
   	... He's already talking,
   	if this thing goes like they think it is,
   	next fall he's wanting to,
   	... start looking at expanding that .. storage facility.
   	(H) It's one of those things,
   	I think there's --
   	.. they're always gonna have .. (H) quite a bit of debt,
   	so long as cash flow'll keep up with it.
   	.. Cause,
   	you know he's --
   	.. that's= kind of their,
   	(H) you know he's looking at that as his retirement income,
   	and an investment,
   	and this whole bit,
   	you know,
   	like some of the people do here.
   	... % Well it's been moved and seconded,
   	.. um,
   	.. to approve,
   	but ... that,
   	... % we can't really disburse on that.
   	... That,
   	.. due to his size,
   	.. (H) [of the loan],
   	       [until we have] all --
   	They [2need f-2] [3.. f-3] --
   	     [2all the board2] [3members3]?
   	                 [3majority of3] board member.
   	[4Yeah4].
   	[4Four4] --
   	.. uh f- --
   	At least two more board members,
   	[because] I'm voting,
   	[Yeah].
   	.. all in --
   	.. I'm voting .. in [favor of it],
   	                    [In favor],
   	and,
   	.. Yeah.
   	.. [<X See I was X>] --
   	   [since you sec]onded it,
   	I assume so are [2you2].
   	                [2Yeah2].
   	Yeah.
   	So see I've got two --
   	and then I'll try to,
   	(H) I'll get hold of two more.
   	I was gonna see ~Wilbur,
   	but he didn't --
   	s- .. ~Dave didn't get in here until,
   	.. after he was gone,
   	.. so,
   	... that's the only one I have.
   	... Any other loans.
   	... No other loans to be discussed.
   	... I got a .. couple things here,
   	but uh,
   	... we'll um,
   	... the one,
   	... is in regard to,
   	... the retail,
   	... nondeposit investment,
   	(H) just to kind of bring us up to speed,
   	(H) .. m- .. ~M=att has tentatively accepted our ... offer for employment,
   	... but since he's going to be a dual employee,
   	... th- --
   	you really don't need to put this in the minutes.
   	[XX --
   	[Hm.
   	.. Okay].
   	I'll I'll c-] --
   	I'll catch up .. the board up to speed,
   	I just want us to know,
   	because (H) it has some loan relevance.
   	(H) .. Uh= he was interviewed by LCL,
   	!Larry !Harb interviewed him over the telephone yesterday (Hx),
   	and,
   	.. !Larry called me this morning,
   	... that's who had called about seven-thirty,
   	and said everything went fine.
   	(H) U=m,
   	... (TSK) what --
   	.. what we have set up is,
   	~Matt's going up to Chicago,
   	(H) at LCL's office,
   	.. on uh,
   	... for .. Monday evening,
   	... Tuesday,
   	(H) and Wednesday training.
   	.. The f- --
   	The Monday evening and Tuesday training,
   	(H) will be very specific for him,
   	(H) their workflow,
   	their forms,
   	he'll get to meet these people.
   	(H) On Wednesday then,
   	he'll be in a little bit of a larger group,
   	... (H) there may be four or five other asset managers with him,
   	(H) discussing sails .. motivations and,
   	(H) and .. and sales approaches and strategies,
   	(H) ... % ... !Larry said,
   	Ph- he doesn't know how ~Matt's gonna plug into us,
   	... philosophically,
   	and how well he's known in the area.
   	... He said that's our decision.
   	.. Of which,
   	.. I- you know,
   	I'm comfortable with.
   	(H) ... I wanted !Larry to tell me how he thinks he's gonna do,
   	plugging into the selling,
   	and he said oh,
   	you --
   	he should be --
   	he should do very well.
   	... So I- I'm,
   	um,
   	tho- --
   	.. that looks good.
   	... (H) What I did,
   	.. kind of,
   	.. (H) in regard to that,
   	was,
   	... and,
   	.. I don't have this date finalized,
   	but,
   	(H) s- --
   	.. I'm trying to go maybe the second week .. of .. January,
   	(H) to ha=ve ... a representative of Bankers Systems,
   	(H) .. come <<THUMP ++here THUMP>>.
   	... to do some specialized training,
   	... within the qualified retirement plan ... area.
   	... ~Matt needs,
   	(H) .. ~Matt .. needs an understanding of,
   	... not a detailed understanding,
   	but how all these qualified plans work,
   	... (H) so that he w- ... can have,
   	... so he understands how,
   	(H) his products plug into the (H) to the self-directed IRAs,
   	SEPs,
   	and the like.
   	(H) We also,
   	.. it would do us .. good to know what products we can offer,
   	(H) under those qualified retirement plans.
   	(H) So,
   	.. uh R- --
   	!Ray !Galino I I believe is his name is,
   	(H) supposed to come down,
   	... I haven't set up a date,
   	(H) ... but,
   	... he'll be here .. on a f- --
   	for a day,
   	and I wanted him to talk with ~Matt,
   	(H) ~Vivian,
   	myself,
   	.. and,
   	.. sometime during the day to the two of you.
   	(H) Because as loan officers,
   	(H) you have a good (H) handle on .. borrowers and,
   	... and can kind of tell them of these SEPs,
   	and some of the other products.
   	(H) Uh,
   	we've kind of hesitated [in .. in offering those],
   	                        [(H)=]
   	(H) .. well,
   	we have not offered the self-directed.
   	[Hm].
   	[(H)] Offering the self-directed we're getting,
   	is simply,
   	(H) we need to get a dif- --
   	fifty different forms.
   	.. Instead of (H) called an IRA,
   	... it's called an IRA SD,
   	.. for self-directed.
   	.. And then,
   	.. that will allow people,
   	(H) to,
   	.. if they don't want .. all their funds in .. a bank CD,
   	as .. as are custodial IRA arrangements.
   	See,
   	the existing IRA says,
   	(H) all those funds have to be in First National Bank of ~Hillsdale.
   	(H) The self-directed,
   	... the .. the participant signs a (H) an investment ... direction,
   	... or,
   	... where where ... he directs ... the investments.
   	... They sign the form,
   	[and then you invest in whatever they want] to.
   	[Yeah.
   	XX XXX].
   	(H) Uh=,
   	... the,
   	.. what.
   	How that works like with the SEPs,
   	(H) ... the SEP ... has a vehicle,
   	.. has to be connected to the IRA.
   	... So we take the SEP off the shelf,
   	... and then if the person .. wants that money put into a bank CD,
   	(H) then we just use our custodial .. IRA forms.
    	(H) .. If .. they want a self-directed i%- ... SEP,
     	(H) you take the same .. SEP form off,
     	(H) but you're using a different (H) .. IRA.
     	... You're not using [the custodial] IRA arrangement,
D:   	                     [Oh,
     	okay].
:    	(H) % An SEP must have an IRA (H) attached to it.
     	.. [So that-] --
D:   	   [So,
     	the IRAs] all fit in the same .. plan.
     	.. They're just different ... ch- boxes checked off of this overall ... plan.
     	And that,
     	.. the overall plan is what you're talking about goes back,
     	that's what the IRS has blessed.
:    	Right.
     	They --
D:   	is the framework,
     	and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination,
     	you're okay.
:    	... Exactly.
     	(H) So,
     	.. I .. I had [talked with] .. with !Rick uh !Brady today,
D:   	              [(THROAT)]
:    	(H) and,
     	... he's gonna send me those forms,
     	so we can take a look at em,
     	.. (H) The other --
     	The thing which makes it a little more complicated,
     	but (H) it's really not a cost,
     	(H) ... it's kind of a s- .. flip-flop,
     	in that,
     	(H) he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those self-directed IRAs ourselves.
     	(H) .. Because of how complicated [the law] is in all this,
D:   	                                  [Mhm].
:    	so,
D:   	[Mhm].
:    	[(H)]
     	.. I mean,
     	... coincidentally Banker Systems offers a comprehensive [account] [2(H) maintainance2] services,

D:   	                                       [2(Hx)2]
:    	(H) In a similar manner,
     	if you will,
     	a=s (H) ... they take care of the,

:    	.. Mhm.
:    	(H) .. We- --
     	They- --
     	... We send them the information,
     	[th-] --

     	.. and they [file whatever] needs to be filed.
:    	            [disclose it],
     	[2Mhm2].
:    	[2(H)2] The --
     	... It's really not gonna cost us,
     	it it's gonna be pretty much of a swap.
     	Right now,
     	(H) we use their eight-hundred number,
     	... a=nd .. their,
     	.. uh,
     	... fi- --
     	.. their newsletter.
     	... for the IRAs.
     	.. We don't have their comprehensive service,
     	we have their IRA service.
     	(H) And that runs about three-hundred dollars a year.
     	... If you= go to the comprehensive account maintenance,
     	... the eight-hundred number is included,
     	and the f- --
     	and the newsletter is included.
     	.. So we would drop three-hundred dollars off.
     	(H) The account maintenance,
     	... comprehensive account <X maintenance X>,
     	... maintenance would cost us five-hundred dollars.
     	(H) But,
     	... what you do= is,
     	.. they- --
     	... he estimates it'd be five-hundred dollars,
     	for a minimal number of accounts,
     	(H) Banker System charges thirty-five dollars ... an account.
     	... And he said under a self-directed arrangement,
     	... he's seen ... charges,
     	.. to maintain a self-directed IRA,
     	.. anywhere from forty (H) to a hundred fifty dollars.
     	Now I think a hundred fifty dollars (H) is a lot,
     	(H) [to maintain] a self-directed IRA.
D:   	    [Mhm].
     	.. [2So you mean2],
:    	   [2%=2] --
D:   	.. that you --
     	w=e could pass that back to the customer?
     	.. [That's] what you're saying,
:    	   [Right].
     	Right.
     	[(H) We] --
D:   	[They] charge us five-hundred plus thirty-five per account?
:    	.. Well he- he thought --
     	he's gonna send me down the information,
     	you know how the typical salesman,
     	they,
     	(H) they they d=- [talk in] kind of nebulous terms,
D:   	                  [Yeah].
:    	[2but he2] thought,
D:   	[2Okay2].
:    	(H) w- they --
     	.. they have a minimum (H) number .. of accounts,
     	... %=
D:   	.. Oh,
     	with w- --
     	.. is covered if you will by the five-[hundred.
:    	                                      [(H) Yes].
D:   	.. Okay].
:    	And so he said,
     	(H) .. % % % way I understood it would,
     	... let's say five-hundred would would cover the eight-hundred,
     	.. which is very very helpful service,
D:   	[Mhm].
:    	[(H)] and uh,
     	... the .. maintenance for let's say twenty accounts.
     	... Well,
     	.. if we had [..] ten accounts,
D:   	             [Okay].
:    	.. we would charge (H) % .. five-hundred fifty dollars on ac- on an account,
     	it would be five-hundred dollars,
     	it's really kind of a switch around but,
     	(H) what .. what that would --
     	.. I think it would be good for (H) .. the five or six of us,
     	(H) to,
     	... to have !Galino down here,
     	(H) can kind of explain what products,
     	... we can offer from the bank side,
:    	... Hm.
:    	~Matt needs to know that,
     	and .. and we all need to know that,
     	(H) and then,
     	... we can figure out how ~Matt's,
     	... the products that LCL's gonna offer will plug into that.
     	... And it's --
     	... I was thinking of sending ~Matt up there for a week,
     	(H) but,
     	(H) ... you know he's up there a week,
     	he's gonna learn a lot of very technical .. information,
     	such as like those section four-fifteen (H) XSes.
     	.. That .. @that I was talking about.
     	(H) You really don't need to know the (H) the technical (H) ...
     	nitty-gritty ... about it,
     	.. because,
     	... that's what Bankers Systems does.
     	[They] take care of the nitty-gritty,
:    	[Hm].
:    	So,
     	(H) it's gonna be less expensive,
     	.. to have ... !Galino come here,
     	... instead of one person going up to .. to Minnesota for a week,
     	... and then trying to bring back the information,
     	... we're gonna have !Galino come down here for a day,
     	... and,
     	he won't --
     	.. he won't touch any (H) specific .. complicated .. items.
     	.. Such as four-fifteen XSes or,
     	(H) or ACP testing or that.
     	... Cause ~Vivian and I kind of know that,
     	(H) but if we don't know that,
:    	(THROAT)
:    	like that four-fifteen [.. uh] XS,
D:   	                       [Mhm].
:    	(H) I called the eight-hundred number,
     	and .. and they went through the explanation,
     	where the IRS (H) changed ... the the deduction.
D:   	... Just a --
     	... Just a ... question.
     	... from a mechanics.
     	(H) Who's gonna ho=ld the account.
     	.. Is LCL ... gonna hold the account,
     	is the bank gonna ... ho- ... hold the account,
     	.. Who act- --
     	.. You know,
     	you're talking about bank products,
     	and .. and LCL products,
     	like before,
     	the trust department,
     	(H) if you will,
     	held (H) the account.
     	.. That that's physically where it [was,
:    	                                   [Mhm].
D:   	you know],
     	Is (H) is it's --
     	.. I%- %= .. is the plan .. % % gonna be in the bank,
     	or will the plan be in LCL,
     	or is the plan (H) % just kind of nebulous,
:    	... Well --
     	.. well the .. the SEP and the IRA,
     	(H) will- will be First National Bank of ~Hillsdale.
D:   	... Okay.
     	.. [That's what I meant].
:    	   [But .. but] tho- [2those2] --
D:   	                     [2They're2] bank products.
     	... if you will.
     	.. We offer those,
     	(H) and then LCL,
     	if .. w=ill have,
     	... within that plan,
     	they'll have things you can buy,
     	if you want to direct it that way.
     	... [If you] don't want a CD,
:    	    [Tha- the-] --
D:   	or if you= want something else,
     	(H) you could direct that,
     	(H) that the monies be used to buy= ... some mutual fund,
     	or some bond fund or something.
:    	Right.
     	[And how I] envision that then,
D:   	[Okay].
:    	(H) we would get ... the .. statement .. from LCL,
     	.. for the .. mutual fund holdings,
     	(H) [let's say] the person also had a CD.
D:   	    [Okay].
     	[2Mhm2],
:    	[2Let's2] --
     	.. You know,
     	it doesn't matter [how <X they X> split it].
D:   	                  [Like we do now].
:    	(H) And then .. then,
     	(H) ... what what we would have to do is,
     	.. pull that information together.
     	(H) We would get LCL's statement,
     	... as of .. the end of the year.
     	What the income was,
     	(H) and what the balance was,
     	we would then have to,
     	if they had a CD,
     	(H) pull that in,
     	we would report that (H) up to Bankers Systems,
D:   	[Okay].
D:   	[(H)] and they would then combine that,
     	.. and produce the report.
     	(H) It --
     	.. That's why there's .. normally a cost in those self-directed,
     	(H) because,
     	... it's not,
     	(H) .. with our CDs now,
     	(H) that information,
     	.. that's the whole account,
     	.. and whatever's out there on the .. on the retire-,
     	on the RAP record,
     	(H) just passes right up,
     	... and .. and the CD and the RAP information,
     	r- [retirement] account ... processing system talk together.
D:   	   [Mhm].
:    	(H) When you get another vendor in here,
     	like LCL,
     	(H) we physically have to put the papers together.
     	But it's not that complicated.
:    	[But the] name of his office is gonna be LCL.
:    	[S-] --
:    	It's not gonna be First National Bank,
     	(H)
:    	Right.
     	.. Right.
:    	[Anything].
:    	[(H) The-] the --
     	... I got a f- --
     	Oh (Hx).
     	Yeah,
     	.. I love ... expansions of business.
     	[It took me] forty-five minutes to get a phone number.
D:   	[@ (Hx)]
:    	... [2The phone number by the way is2],
:    	    [2For LCL.
     	.. Yeah2].
:    	<<POUND +~five +~five +~five,
     	... +~five +~five .. +~five +~five POUND>>.
     	... Is what the phone number will be.
     	(H) .. But,
     	.. this is .. things that,
     	(H) I'm I'm .. anxious for ~Matt to get here,
     	because I'm getting,
     	(H) .. I'm getting tuckered out,
     	[trying to] .. get all these nitty-gritty things,
D:   	[@@]
:    	It's not tough to get the phone number.
     	(H) But see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead,
:    	[Mhm].
:    	[(H)] in order to or- .. % have business cards.
     	(H) .. LCL in [2..2] in Chicago needs that,
D:   	              [2Mhm2].
:    	.. to get that process [3going3].
:    	                       [3Hm3].
:    	[4Uh,
:    	[4(TSK) (H) Uh is there LCL4] accounts gonna be maintained here,

:    	I mean,
     	or .. is there gonna be a separate,
     	(H) They're gonna have an account in Chicago,
     	for the funds to pass through?
     	Or is it gonna be passthrough funds here at the bank?
     	Or,
     	(H) is that %= --
:    	... Well,
     	.. w- .. what we'll do is,
     	... those'll probably wire transfer [out].
:    	                                    [Through Bolt]mans or something,
:    	Well,
     	.. through the Fed,
     	what --
     	(H) I think what will happen,
     	(H) but we --
     	.. ~Matt'll find this out,
     	and,
     	I mean,
     	we'll get involved in it,
     	(H) and I'm --
     	I'm not --
     	... whichever way it goes is fine,
     	but probably the most sophisticated way,
     	(H) will be,
     	(H) everyone who makes --
     	... who buys a fund,
     	or whatever,
     	... that money will go into a .. a clearing account here.
     	... And then,
     	(H) we will,
     	... either LCL will .. will [ACH it .. out of us],
:    	                            [XX XX]
:    	.. Or,
     	... we'll physically wire it up there.
     	... <%<X You know X>%>,
     	there may be (H) ... a hundred thousand dollars in there,
     	which may represent ... three people's,
     	or four people's [..] purchases,
:    	                 [Mhm].
:    	(H) and then ~Matt faxes the paperwork up to LCL,
     	... and they do the suitability testing,
     	... and then they know ... what products have been bought,
     	... and then on the other side,
     	.. we do a wire transfer,
     	.. to physically get the money up there.
     	I think [that's how it's gonna work].
D:   	        [Si- .. similar to Fannie] Mae.

     	But that's --
     	(H) that's kind of the .. the mechanics of the .. of the flow of funds.
     	(H) But,
     	to answer your question ~Joe,
     	is that,
     	(H) LCL,

     	(H) U=m,

     	... there needs to be a .. separate phone line,
     	... <<POUND +going .. to +that +office POUND>>.
     	(H) And we'll --
     	we'll be able-,
     	when we get this receptionist set up,
     	(H) the receptionist will also answer it,
     	.. but when they pick up the phone,
     	(H) .. you know we'll put it on a red line,
     	or .. blue line or something like that,
     	(H) when they pick up that line,
     	like we do with with with ~Bill's number,

     	(H) and the comptroller that,
     	.. they don't .. want us,
     	(H) when that line rings,
     	we're not gonna pick it up and go,
     	hello,
     	First National Bank of ~Hillsdale,
     	and they go,
     	(H) <Q oh yeah,

AM:	[<P @@ P>]
AJUAN:	he wouldn't speak to me for six months,
the first time we messed around we were drunk.
.. And we messed around.
And he wouldn't speak to me for six months,
and said it was my fault that he knows he's not gay.
.. But yet he was the one that grabbed me and threw me on the floor.
AM:	.. He [confronted you and said] that to you?
AJUAN:	[And got on top of me].
... (H) .. I called him,
AM:	Oh.
AJUAN:	the next day after it had happened.
(H) And he said I don't want to talk to you,
(H) you took advantage of me when I was drunk.
But he's the one that grabbed me,
(H) kissed me,
... took my underwear off,
... a=nd,
.. he started it.
... You know,
I knew= .. what I was about.
.. I .. didn't .. get into it,
but I knew.
AM:	.. Right.
AJUAN:	... And,
he was the one,
that was the first experience.
And then the second experience,
(H) he didn't speak to me for three months,
... % because he blamed me for that.
And then=,
.. the third experience he blamed me for,
(H) he's been blaming me for all of these experiences,
up unti=l,
... uh= li=ke,
.. ~Scott and I got serious like the year after,
and I was still k=ind of seeing ~Darren,
(H) I went out to Washington and stuff,
(H) and that's when he sto=pped blaming me.
Now=,
(H) he calls me and tells me that he wants to be with me.
... And,
.. he called --
Like he called me last week,
and said he wanted to be with me.
AM:	... You're kidding.
AJUAN:	.. No.
.. But he's married to ~Lauren.
... And I keep telling him,
get out of that relationship,
.. before you have children.
... Just get out of it,
.. don't carry any by- baggage with you.
... Always my biggest theory.
Don't carry any excess baggage.
AM:	.. Mm=.
AJUAN:	With you.
(H) And he lo=ves her.
But what he doesn't know how to separate is,
(H) he loves her but he's not in love with her.
... You know what I mean,
[he he just --
AM:	[Right right.
Oh] yeah,
AJUAN:	(H)]
AM:	you can love a person,
.. but .. you're not [in love] with them,
AJUAN:	[(THROAT)]
AM:	It's not sexual.
AJUAN:	... Yeah.
... (H) And that's really har[=d].
AM:	[(THROAT)]
AJUAN:	.. Becau=se,
AM:	(SNIFF)
AJUAN:	... you you find it very difficult to be,
.. to love someone and,
when you tell someone you love them,
(H) they misunderstand,
what love is all about.
So,
... (TSK) I don't know.
But I d- I,
.. (H) I think if there was ever anybody,
.. I truly --
But he k- --
.. He=,
.. (H) everybody has that one person who breaks their heart,
and he broke my heart.
.. Just incredibly because,
.. (H) I wasn't really in love with his looks,
I= just,
... I've never met anybody who when you .. they touched you,
just,
.. there was so much warmth.
And so much,
.. (H) just --
There was so much .. energy there.
.. (H) Tha=t,
.. I mean,
AM:	(TSK) So you've .. kept [in con]tact with him?
AJUAN:	[<P % Mm P>],
.. yes=.
Since nineteen --
... Yeah.
AM:	... That's ama[zing].
AJUAN:	[I've been] here,
for all this time,
AM:	.. What does he just call,
or you call,
<P<X when he's X>P> --
AJUAN:	No.
.. He calls me.
... I can't call him.
AM:	... Oh.
AJUAN:	... (H)= Actually I can,
cause his wife knows that we're friends.
.. But I don't choose to call him.
... (H) He --
... Like he used to travel,
[around] the country,
AM:	[(SNIFF)]
AJUAN:	they live --
They used to live in [~Valencia] California,
AM:	[(THROAT)]
AJUAN:	now they live somewhere,
... they just moved,
cause his wife got a new job.
(H) He quit his job for her,
... for her= .. job.
Cause she moved to California for them,
cause they were living in Washington DC.
(H) So he used to travel all around the world.
(H) Well whenever he come to Wisconsin for the dairy expo,
or he'd come here,
.. (H) go to Chicago for .. some reason,
to take businessmen around,
(H) what he did was,
(H) .. %uh,
he took f=- uh farmers around from arou- different parts of the world,
so that they can look at farms.
(H) So his travel a lot of times was in Wisconsin,
.. because of the farms here.
.. (H) They would see how= .. things were done and,
he- --
... He like took them around .. (TSK) the world.
.. (H) You know doing this.
And he traveled all over the world.
(H) See,
tha=t's why,
... I think ~Darren no=w,
is getting to this point where,
(H) .. he's with ~Lauren all the ti=me.
... And before,
~Darren traveled like ninety percent of the year.
... He was gone.
.. I mean,
~Darren was gone ninety percent of the year.
... So now he's with ~Lauren .. ev=ery day,
and it's been this way for the last three or four months.
.. (H) And I [think k] --
AM:	[Oh that's] all?
... For the last three or four months?
[Oh] --
AJUAN:	[He just] started stop --
They've been married six years.
.. He [just stopped trav]eling.
AM:	[Oh=]?
AJUAN:	... And I think now it's just like,
... I don't know if this is for me,
I don't know if this is right,
(H) and he's starting to call me.
And he's starting to tell me how much he cares for me,
and how he has feelings for me,
and I --
(H) I know that you're with ~Scott.
(H) And I'm just li=ke,
... and I'm not giving up my life for you.
.. (H) He asked me once,
right out of college,
when he moved to Washington DC,
... when I came back,
from California,
and I was here,
and I had just started working,
(H) he asked me to move to ~Madison.
... To be with him.
.. That was when he was on the peak of thinking maybe I am gay.
.. (H) And I said,
... well=,
.. why don't I come out there first,
and we'll see.
So I went out there,
(H) and he goes,
(H) well yeah you can move out here and get your own apartment,
whereas he owned a three-bedroom hou=se,
... and lived by himself,
and I'm like,
... okay,
can I afford to move out here,
get a apartment,
until I fi=nd --
He never said move in here with me until you find a place or whatever.
(H) It was just li=ke,
.. (H) and then he wanted the still straight life,
... and this and that and other.
So now he claims bisexuality,
.. (H) but he's moving closer I think <X to steps of being X> gay,
.. (H) because when he was talking to me on the phone last week,
... he was telling me how much he still loved me.
... And he doesn't know what to do about this whole sit[uation].
AM:	[How could he] really love you though,
he doesn't know you that much.
AJUAN:	(H) He doesn't know me,
because in the last ten years,
(H) we talked to each other maybe once a month.
AM:	... Well that's quite a bit though.
AJUAN:	And actually maybe not even that.
Sometimes it's every other month.
When he was traveling around the world,
(H) like he went to Germany for six weeks.
And he sent me his frequent flyer ticket.
.. (H) .. Cause he was there,
.. training to t- speak,
learning to speak German in a six-week course.
(H) And he sent [me],
AM:	[(THROAT)]
AJUAN:	.. a free- k- to- .. to come and spend a week with him,
and I said no.
(H) But at that time,
.. I would- been with ~Scott like four years,
and I was just like,
@(Hx)
.. I don't think so.
You're not gonna use me,
for your little sex thing for that (H) week,
and then that's it,
so,
... (TSK) (H) I mean,
... I st- I love him,
.. [I real]ly do but,
AM:	[<P Hm P>].
AJUAN:	I don't --
... (H) I also don't trust him.
.. I don't think any man,
.. (H) who ... is as sexual as he w- .. is,
... % and traveled as much as he did,
.. could stay,
.. celibate,
or- or stay t- t- committed to his wi=fe.
AM:	.. Right.
AJUAN:	.. I mean when y- I saw him once in Chicago,
... I went to Chicago.
.. About .. four years ago?
.. Five years ago?
... A=nd he was in Chicago,
in this <VOX really nice VOX> hotel,
and he (H) said,
why don't you come and,
.. you know,
I='m free Saturday,
... and Sunday.
Why don't you come.
And I said fine.
So I took the train to Chicago on Saturday,
.. (H) and I thought okay no big deal,
he'll have .. a room with two double beds.
.. No it was a king-size bed.
(H) So I thought,
okay,
no big deal,
I took a sleeping bag,
just in case.
(H) So,
here I am,
.. taking my sleeping bag,
I roll it out on the floor,
and he goes,
(H)= %(Hx)
well you don't have to worry,
you can share this bed with me,
I love ~Lauren,
... and --
No= I take that back.
.. (H) It was more than five years ago,
because he's been married to ~Lauren for six years this coming May,
... no.
Seven years this coming May.
(H) So it was m=ore than six years ago because,
.. it was when he asked ~Lauren to marry him,
it was right around Christmas time.
(H) So it's been about six and a half years so,
(H) he asked ~Lauren to marry him,
(H) and he says I really love ~Lauren,
X I'm gonna marry her,
and blah blah blah this.
(H) So I get in the bed,
I thought fine,
no big deal.
.. I'm wearing my t-shirt and my underwear,
so I get in the bed,
... (H) and in the morning I wake up,
.. and here he is,
... fondling me.
... (TSK) So I'm like,
okay,
so,
do you leave,
or what do you do.
... You know,
so %,
.. I'm like ~Darren,
... % he goes,
just don't say anything.
And I said ~Darren,
... this isn't right,
.. you don't really want to be with me,
.. you just want .. the sexual part.
... And I said that's all there is to it,
and I just can't do this.
... And ... he accepted it,
and I I don't know= --
... He always,
and he'll always ask me,
(H) well how's ~Scott,
.. (H) how is your sex life with ~Sco=tt.
.. Are you happy with ~Scott,
.. you know,
do you still miss me.
.. (H) And I'm like,
.. well ~Darren I haven't told you I missed you in years.
What are you [talking about].
AM:	[@(Hx)= @@@@@]
AJUAN:	You know,
@it's like,
k- excuse me.
[(H) .. %%]
AM:	[% Is he like full of himself] or what.
AJUAN:	... (TSK) (H) And he's another one too.
AM:	(THROAT)
AJUAN:	He knows .. he's .. good-looking.
He he's another one.
.. When we were were in college,
he knew it.
AM:	.. Mm.
AJUAN:	.. And .. and what really gets me is th- % that,
... (TSK) (H) I think,
.. the reason I always attra=cted,
like I attracted a lot of football players,
(H) is people always .. got the impression .. I was gay=.
.. (H) So,
if they knew you were gay=,
and they wanted some .. experience,
and they .. (H) they didn't want to approach another .. say man in your fra=t.
.. (H) .. And they kinda thou=ght you were gay=,
and nobody really wanted to (H) like say it,
.. they would approach me.
AM:	.. [Mm=].
AJUAN:	[(H) So] I always got all the good-looking ones to always like,
.. come after me.
AM:	.. <P Mm= P>.
AJUAN:	And that's how I ended up with ~Ron,
and how I ended up with ~Darren.
And I and I realize that,
(H) you know I always think well,
especially ~Ron.
I mean <% he= was just like %>,
.. oh,
.. just .. perfect.
Well ~Darren was too but,
(H) ~Darren,
(H) a lot of people don't like auburn hair or reddish brown hair.
They don't .. ca- care for it.
But ~Ron just is just a- --
.. (H) just a beautiful man.
They both were but,
(H) I find that that's what happens in these fraternities.
Is you find a man who .. is curious about his sexuality.
.. (H) And if they find someone who they question,
.. okay,
is he gay or isn't he gay,
.. (H) then they will tend to .. go after you a little bit faster.
(H) So then you think,
okay you've seen some of these guys in the bars and you think,
... (TSK) like I was out .. at the Triangle,
and I saw this guy,
he was so= good-looking,
I'm like,
AM:	(THROAT)
AJUAN:	(H) how the hell did he end up with that .. <VOX thi=ng VOX>.
(H) And then I thought you know,
I betcha he's just out --
And he was from Marquette,
(H) and he .. was just finding out,
and he met this guy=,
.. and that's why he was out with him.
AM:	Oh=[=],
AJUAN:	[You] know,
I mean,
AM:	[When was] this,
AJUAN:	[it-] --
.. (TSK) (H) This was probab- --
This was a while back.
This was --
AM:	They young?
AJUAN:	.. Yeah.
[Well the w-] --
AM:	[Oh].
AJUAN:	(H) They were young.
(H) The one guy in particular was young.
The guy that was from Marquette.
AM:	.. [Mm].
AJUAN:	[Was] probably,
I f- --
I wouldn't think he would be more than ... twenty,
... twenty-one,
I couldn't- --
But he shouldn't have been in the Triangle if you want to know the truth.
... So=,
.. but,
.. um=,
.. no=,
(H) he was just very ni=ce.

ENNIFER:	.. % The object,
okay,
every] heart,
... okay,
every heart is one [point,
AN:	                   [Is tr-] --
ENNIFER:	the q-] queen of spades is thirteen points,
the object is not to have any points.
.. And,
(H) you p=lay following suit,
... an=d,
... you can take,
if you take tricks,
th- the highest card of the suit,
takes the trick.
If you don't have the card of the suit,
[you throw] (H) whatever you want.
AN:	[(H)]
Okay.
So h- hearts,
.. and the queen of spades,
ENNIFER:	Are [bad].
AN:	    [are the] only thing.
ENNIFER:	That are --
AN:	That --
[that have points].
ENNIFER:	[That are points].
Right.
[(H) So if you- --
AN:	(H) .. So],
ENNIFER:	if you throw] --
%
[Look okay)].
AN:	[y-] --
ENNIFER:	(H)
AN:	so we got like three points,
right here.
... [Right].
ENNIFER:	    [we] have three points in our hand,
[2exactly2].
AN:	[2And we w- wanna2] try to get [3rid of that3].
ENNIFER:	                               [3(H) N_Right3],
but we're pa=ssing.
Now the first thing you do is you pa=ss three cards to your left.
(H) Now these are low hearts.
So I can --
.. I'm not gonna pass those.
I'm gonna pass,
... the f- [.. four of] clubs,
AN:	           [All the --
y- right-] --
... Why is that.
ENNIFER:	... And these are two high --
why --
just because.
(H) And --
cause you should always pass a club,
.. so that the person --
(H) .. so that the first hand,
%y- .. everyone has a club,
so that they can't .. discard a heart.
Cause you always assume that everyone's t- --
no one is voi=d,
of a suit.
(H) The first time around,
so you don't have to worry about throwing a high [card.
AN:	                                                 [Yeah.
.. Yeah].
ENNIFER:	(H)] And then I'm gonna throw two high cards,
so I don't take those tricks.
(H) [Because (Hx)] -- 
AN:	    [(H) But what] difference does it make if you take a [2trick.
ENNIFER:	[2(H) Well because 0- --
AN:	They're not worth anything2].
ENNIFER:	(H) Cause if I2]= t- --
If I take a tr- --
the k- diamond trick,
(H) and somebody didn't have diamonds,
and they threw a heart into that pile,
I was gonna take that,
with that ace.
... So if I throw an ace of diamonds,
and somebody doesn't have any diamonds,
they're gonna throw a heart on me,
and I'm [gonna have to] take that [2trick2].
AN:	        [(TSK) (H)]
                                  [2Okay,
but,
but if they play hearts,
that doesn't --
.. that doesn't win anything.
... [I- --
ENNIFER:	    [If they play h- --
AN:		n_okay.
Just go ahead and play].
ENNIFER:	Okay.
Alright]?
So I'm passing three s_three cards.
(H) [And I got],
AN:	    [(Hx)]
ENNIFER:	the seven of hearts,
three of hearts,
and the king of f- spades.
Begin play.
(H) The two of clubs always leads,
% .. I'm gonna throw the ace of clubs,
assuming I'm gonna take this [trick,
AN:	                             [Okay- --
.. Okay.
ENNIFER:	(H) no one <X have to X>] --
AN:	and then- --
and everybody] --
ENNIFER:	Right.
(H)
AN:	So it's kinda risky playing the king,
since,
ENNIFER:	But I'm gonna assume everyone [has clubs] still.
AN:	                              [Okay].
Alright.
[XXX]
ENNIFER:	[Okay,
cause there are] thirteen cards,
I'm assuming it's an equal deal.
Now there are eight clubs out,
(H) that means there are only f=our more left.
AN:	So you don't --
y- --
.. so you wanna play,
ENNIFER:	.. [So I'm gonna-] --
AN:	   [A high] d- --
high diamond.
ENNIFER:	(H) ... Yeah,
exactly.
Like a high diamond (Hx).
So jack of diamonds.
.. Okay,
[taken with= -- 
AN:	[Okay,
so he took that.
ENNIFER:	Okay.
(H) Now the] spade,
AN:	so now] --
ENNIFER:	Now this is a tricky one,
now,
If I have a high spade now,
I'd throw it,
(H) because I could take this trick,
and the h- my highest spade would be out.
Now I don't ever wanna take the queen of spades,
(H) high spades are dangerous because you might --
queen of spades is a hard cr- card to get [rid of].
AN:	                                          [(H)] So if,
.. yeah okay,
[I see].
ENNIFER:	[Now I] don't have- --
oh I do have a [2spade2].
AN:	               [2Well you're in a good2] position now,
because you've seen what everybody else has played.
ENNIFER:	... Right.
That's why.
(H) [Diamond,
AN:	    [So you have to play a diamond.
ENNIFER:	(H) Now h-] --
AN:	Right]?
ENNIFER:	Right,
and there have been no diamond- --
Has there been a diamond trick?
[There's been one diamond trick.
AN:	[uh=,
y- --
.. yeah.
ENNIFER:	w-] only one though.
AN:	Yeah].
ENNIFER:	Right?
AN:	Yeah.
ENNIFER:	.. Okay.
AN:	... Yeah,
you played your ace.
ENNIFER:	Okay now it was le=d,
.. the spade was led,
... (H) but there's a heart in this trick.
So I wanna get under the seven.
ENNIFER:	... Because I don't wanna take this trick.

Luther hatched.
(TSK) And um,
hen you come then,
o= (Hx),
ver this debate.
his freedom of the will.
Um,
I think uh,
me read you a .. page from Brendler.
ecause it sets the sa- stage very nicely.
 is in the Luther book some of you are reading,
and um,
if you,
this evening when you go home,
ou wanna meditate it on more,
 on- on it more,
 on page three eleven.
(TSK) (H) It's on page three eleven.
H) But,
me just read you the-,
e this gives us the setting very nicely,
then .. we can .. uh,
H) <READ Erasmus entitled his anti-Luther pamphlet,
diatribe .. concerning free will.
(TSK) (H) Once again,
the first .. (H) and fundamental questions,
uted in fifteen sixteen,
fifteen seventeen,
again in Heidelberg,
n April of fifteen eighteen,
 with which Luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology,
 debated.
Luther was glad to take up the the=me of this debate READ>.
(TSK) And this is what Luther writes to Erasmus.
... <READ You alo=ne.
Among all= the others,
have recogni=zed the key= question.
And you do not bore me.
With the Papacy,
urgatory,
ndulgences,
nd similar nonsense.
You,
you alone,
 identifie=d that on which a=ll else hinges.
And you have put the razor to the throat.
And for that .. I thank you heartily.
(H) U=m,
hus Luther evalu- uh evaluated the subject.
 Erasmus commented on the significance (H) of their engagement,
 in battle,
 in his own style READ>.
 (TSK) (H) And he wrote to Luther.
EAD .. (TSK) (H) Perhaps an Erasmus ... who writes ... against you,
) will do more for the Gospel,
) than certain dunderheads ... who support you READ>.
. (H) And then,
 <READ humanistic thinking,
ll never consent READ>,
 this is Brendler now,
s- --
 on this uh,
t this sets the stage for what we're gonna .. talk about,
) <READ humanistic thinking will never conse=nt,
 the doctrine of original sin READ>.
. (TSK) Pico de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin.
 (H) (TSK) The author of uh,
 what is it,
useman I think,
 Invictus.
 <Q I am the master of my fate,
) I am the captain of my soul Q>.
) I don't think that he would (Hx) .. acknowledge original sin.
) <READ Is based READ> uh,
right,
at is it,
's <READ based,
 it is,
 the concept,
at human nature is totally depraved,
) and of itself not capable of any good will.
) (TSK) And that apart from grace alone,
) free will is nothing,
 can do nothing,
 does nothing,
) except depraved deeds.
) Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based,
 and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system,
) they do not appear ... (SWALLOW) reconcilable with the dignity of man- --
gnity of man.
) Catholic,
. and semi-pelagianism,
. (TSK) with all of it's emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace,
) finally views,
 free will,
 as the decisive factor in attaining salvation.
) Thereby conceptualizing free will,
) as similar to a healthy .. man- --
althy human understanding,
) for how can a person,
) be responsible for his dee=ds,
 if he possesses no free will READ>.
. This is what Erasmus asked.
. (H) (TSK) <READ How can he decide between good and evil.
. So reasoned Erasmus.
) Such arguments,
. long known to Luther,
. and many times .. presented to him,
 impressed him (H) not in the least.
. (TSK) God alo=ne is salvation.
) God alo=ne measures guilt.
) He alone condemns.
 alone grants grace.
stifies and saves.
 When he will,
 and whom he will.
) Ma=n can do nothing against the divine prerogative.
) Man can only accept the divine judgment.
. (TSK) This is in fact best.
) And if by --
) And --
 and it is by the divine prerogative,
 that man .. will --
) uh=,
at man is well provided for.
 For God alone is infallible,
 and his being is grace and mercy.
. (TSK) This concept,
) ... that man is divinely elected to salvation,
 to damnation,
) is the center of the predestination dogma.
 That later,
 the Geneva reformer Calvin,
) made the center of his teaching.
) And that subsequently,
der other historical preconditions and circumstances,
) could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class,
 the Netherlands,
d in England READ>.
) ... U=m,
. uh=,
ip this paragraph,
is is the paragraph though.
ght here.
e next one.
SK) (H) .. P- on page three twelve.
en you,
 when you read- --
 you wanna read it later.
) <READ Therefore,
 Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine.
) Such arguments,
 the contrary,
cessarily appeared to Luther,
) given his theological orientation,
) as suspicious.
 From the very start.
) Because they originated from human nature.
) Which exalted itself against God.
 (H) The who=re .. reason.
) Prefers to submit to the Devil.
) Adjusts to all situations.
) And proves .. everything,
at is demanded of her.
. Human nature,
 <MRC does not .. possess .. free will MRC>.
) It is like a horse.
) Ridden by Go=d or the Devil.
. The rider possesses the will.
. The horse .. obeys READ>.
. (H) Well that's as clear as you can get it.
. (TSK) Human nature is like a horse.
. Ridden by Go=d or the Devil.
. The rider possesses free will.
. The horse= obeys.
. Alright that,
_now the debate is joined you see.
d as you come --
 Erasmus comes to this,
's going to say,
) well let's look at the Scriptures.
. (TSK) Now,
 number one,
 have to admit first- --
 v- first off,
) that there see=m to be passages,
ere are passages in the Scriptures,
 are there not?
) (THROAT) Many.
 Which see=m to teach,
at ma=n is responsible for his deeds,
d that he may act,
d has a free will to respond to the invitation of God.
) Isn't that clear in the Scriptures?
) Whosoever wi=ll may come.
. Um,
 Jesus turned to his disciples,
u remember,
en some deserted him,
d .. seemed,
cause they were disappointed in .. some of his sayings,
) and they were offended by some of the things he said,
) ... and they walked no longer with him it said.
. (TSK) And then he turned to those who remained,
d he said,
 Will ye also go away Q>?
. They had a choice.
dn't they?
. Will you go away.
 What do you will.
) .. And the will,
 apparently was,
- resided in .. in these disciples.
) And so Erasmus is going to say,
 obviously,
 Scripture we ha=ve .. paradox.
. We have clea=r passages of Scripture,
) which seem to indicate that ma=n .. <<POUND +has a +free will,
 and that he can +exercise POUND>> that will,
 to follow,
 not to follow.
) To respond or not to respond.
) On the other hand,
) we have passages of Scripture,
) which .. seem to indicate,
. that the will is not free,
. and that the-,
d that man i- th- is- --
n is predestined .. by a .. an omnipotent sovereign will of God.
) ... We have to take both these pass- --
 it's not a question of the Scriptural authority.
  We both accept the scriptural authority.
d Erasmus in his writings,
d in his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio,
 his pamphlet the Liber Arbetrio,
ys to Luther,
- because it is addressed to Luther you see,
) he says to Luther,
) uh,
will not church --
 I will not .. question,
 I not --
will not quote.
will not quote the Church Fathers to you,
) because I understand you accept <@ no Church Father authority,
) if it is in disagreement with your opinion @>.  
) So I will quote the only authority that you recognize,
 The Holy Scriptures.
. (TSK) And so,
 uh,
clusively Erasmus will appeal to the Scriptures,
 his basis.
) When God created Adam and Eve in the garden,
 placed them in the garden,
d he said you have a choice.
)= Uh=,
u have a choice.
 not eat of the fruit of the knowledge of the good- --
 the tree of good and evil,
r on the day ye eat thereof,
 shall surely die.
 Now=,
 not do that,
 and obviously Go=d m=ust have given,
e first (H) created pair,
) a choice.
cause the whole (H) system .. of reward or punishment,
 is based upon the decision which is .. these individuals made.
=,
) when Cai=n slew Abel.
)= (TSK) U=m,
 if you do we=ll?
 Shall you not be s- sustained?
t if you do evil?
) Sin .. crouches at the door.
. If you do well.
. Apparently,
om this,
. Cain .. had the ability,
 even after the mur- --
.000000e+00ven after the murder of Abel,
) he had the ab=ility,
) to make a positive choice.
 According to Erasmus.
at's going to be his position.
) Well Luther,
 (TSK) um,
 I'll g- I'll I'll tell- say some of the things that he he picked first,
asmus picked first,
) and um,
 he's gonna go all through the Scriptures,
d he's gonna take passages like this,
) um,
. (TSK) return return the prophets said,
d they not to ancient Israel.
turn to the God of the covenant,
turn (H) Hosea pleads with Gomer,
 please come back .. t_you see.
) And uh,
is is the symbol of Israel,
me back to the Lord,
) come back to the= the husband of the covenant,
me back to= the one who called you and summoned you,
) it's the- --
asmus says the whole premise is,
) that you have a- an ability,
 return.
at you can make up your mi=nd,
) to change the course that you're now taking.
) And that you can .. go this way,
 or you can go that way.
) And uh,
 then there are other arguments which are,
) uh,
 here's uh,
re's one on um,
ll read an excerpt,
. in this uh,
 this little book,
is is the um,
 the actual uh,
. wr- writings of the s- f- .. freedom of the will,
) .. here's he .. he uses Ecclesiastes.
. God,
d this is a quote,
) from the b- --
 from the book.
) <READ God made man from the beginning,
 (H) and left him in the hand of his own counsel.
. (TSK) He added his commandments,
. (H) and .. precepts.
.  If thou would keep the commandments,
 and perform acceptable .. fidelity forever,
) .. they shall .. preserve thee.
. He hath set w- --
 hath set water and fire before thee.
. Stretch forth thy hand,
) to which thou wilt.
) ... Before man is life and death.
. Good and evil.
. That which he shall choose,
) shall be given him READ>.
. Choose.
. (H) So Erasmus's argument is,
 you have a right to choose.
u can choose.
) And therefore if you can choose,
is presupposes ... (TSK) that you have a free will.
) In any rate,
. if .. man is,
. uh,
 there is a necessity in man's action.
 he is pre=determined to sin.
) .. If .. if God has already determined,
) that this person .. commits these acts.
) Then .. there can be no responsibility on the part of the actor.
) On the part of the perpetrator.
cause how can a person be held responsible (H) for deeds,
) which he does,
 if he= 0mself did not will those,
e- f- --
,
 other words,
 may will those deeds,
t those --
- those deeds were imposed upon his will by a transcendent force.
)= If that is the case,
en there is really no freedom of the will.
) And if uh=,
 that case,
erefore,
person cannot be responsible for his deeds,
) if the deeds which he commits,
ve already been eternally foreordained.
 (SNIFF) This is uh=,
is is going to be then Erasmus's argument,
- on this qu- on this question of the freedom of the will.
) But uh=,
 uh,
) .. we'll .. look at another couple p- uh of his passages.
,
 here it is.
EAD If the will  .. were not free,
. (H) sin could not be attributed to man.
. (TSK) It ceases to be sin.
. If it is not voluntary.
 (H) Free wi=ll is not extinct.
. Though it has contracted a paralysis READ>.
. (SNIFF) ... (H) How is it paralyzed.
ll it's paralyzed by the fall.
. See we all= .. participate in the Adamic nature.
. (TSK) (H) A=nd this Adamic nature,
 uh,
en Adam=,
 in Adam=,
member the New Eng- .. New England primer,
 in Adam's fall,
 sinned all Q>.
NIFF)= So=,
is Adamic nature has been,
 has been passed on to all generation=s of humans.
) And so therefore while we --
) we have a free will,
 is --
 is paralyzed.
 It's not the will .. that was there.
 (H) It's not the will,
. that uh,
. that Adam had.
. Because .. it no longer .. has the freedom .. that Adam had.
 is cursed by sin.
 is under the curse of sin.
) So the human will,
mehow,
 paralyzed.
) ... Uh Erasmus admits that.
) And then,
asmus will say,
at um,
. (TSK) (H) God then enables.
at God does,
d this will be the C- really the modern Catholic view.
) That God will provide a prevenient grace.
. A prevenient grace.
at is in other words,
en though I am unwilling to accept the gift of salvation,
u see,
) that um,
. that God will give me a prevenient grace,
) which will .. enable me,
. to move toward .. this salvation.
. (TSK) (H) And if I then respo=nd.
 positively.
) .. To the gift of God,
) then .. God will extend .. the exemplary grace to me,
 which enables me ... to acquire salvation.
) So prevenient grace,
ll put you on the path.
) ... If you respond on the path,
) then God extends the exemplary grace,
) which will lead you home.
) He uses a little= story.
. A little .. uh .. uh .. allegory.
 Or figure I guess.
) ... (TSK) Uh there uh there's a n-  (Hx) --
. there's a tot,
 a toddler.
. (H) .. (TSK) Uh,
. but he's got to be %- .. big enough to a=ppreciate apples.
 Okay?
 <@ Because,
 his,
) alright,
because that's the,
at's part of the story @>.
) There a .. nice .. shiny .. apple.
 Over here.
. (TSK) (H) .. Over here,
u see.
. And this .. little .. tot,
. he sees the apple.
SK) (H) ... A=nd he uh=,
 he needs,
 he wants to get to this apple.
. (H) U=m,
. so he starts ... in the direction of the apple.
t he's very unsteady.
 wavers.
u see,
d he's not,
) so,
at .. is the prevenient grace.
e prevenient grace is the adult,
) which .. doesn't .. take him .. to the apple,
 doesn't lift him up and put him next to the apple,
) b- but ...% ... goes along with him,
st guiding him,
king sure that he .. he doesn't fall,
) he just,
 he lets hi=m get there. 
) .. But .. he just .. more or less,
) supports or sustains the little tot,
 his motion .. toward the apple.
) So the little tot you see,
. (TSK) Has decided he wants the apple.
ce he sees it,
) .. uh,
en he=,
 moves toward it.
) Prevenient grace assists him .. toward that apple.
) It doesn't,
 as I said,
 doesn't carry him there,
) it doesn't .. go get the apple and bring it to him,
) he must go to the apple.
t he goes= sustained by this prevenient grace.
d then,
) if he,
) .. if he half way to the apple,
 he decides he doesn't want it,
. if he .. if he sees something he th- considers more attractive,
 and he goes off on a tangent,
 goes off in a different direction,
) then you see,
 then his wi=ll has decided that he does not want to cooperate.
. With prevenient grace.
)= Luther hated that word cooperation.
 particularly in connection with grace.
 (H) Now Luther's position is,
 we are dead ... in trespasses and sin.
) You see.
 There is (H) nothing (H) that can .. come to us,
u see now Luther came to his reformation remember,
) with this fear of the righteousness of God.
)= The righteousness of God.
d Luther all through his monastic life,
 until around fifteen fifteen,
s probably when he made that tower discovery.
.. (H) That so-called <L2 Turmerlebnis L2>.
(H) The= tower experience.
... (TSK) Where reading in Romans one seventeen,
... he read,
(H) you know,
... (THROAT) ... the j- the just .. shall live by faith,
well,
.. you have to take rea- really read Romans one sixteen first.
... (H) (TSK) U=m,
.. <READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
.. (H) .. For it is the power of God onto salvation.
... To everyone that believeth,
.. (H) to the Jew first,
... and also to the Greek.
(H)= For therein READ>,
... therein,
it can only refer grammatically to Gospel,
you see.
(H) <READ I am not ashamed of the Gospel.
(H) For therein.
(H) Is the righteousness of Go=d revealed.
... As it is written.
... <MRC The just .. shall live .. by faith MRC>READ>.
... A=nd,
when he discovered this,
he had read this a hundred times.
.. But this one time when he read it,
(H) he said,
... suddenly it dawned on him.
... What this meant.
... <Q And this place in Pau=l Q>,
Luther said,
<Q Became for me,
(H) the gate of paradise Q>.
... <L2 Es ging mir ein Licht auf L2>.
(H) ... The light broke in on me.
(H) ... And what was this light.
... (TSK) That the righteousness of God,
... is passive righteousness.
.. It's not the righteousness,
you see,
Luther said,
<Q I hated that .. that phrase righteousness of God.
(H) What does righteousness of God mean.
(H) Righteousness of God means,
(H) God is holy.
(H) And I'm a sinner.
... And I can never stand in his presence.
(H) And the gulf between us can never be bridged,
.. and he's gonna c=ast me into Hell,
because of my sin.
(H) What shall I do to earn the righteousness of God Q>.
So you see he was constantly (H) preoccupied with this thought,
(H) of somehow,

(H) satisfying the righteousness of God.
(H) Through some work.
.. (H) Through some indulgence.
(H) Through some prayer.
S_through- through- through- renunciation.
Through fasting.
Through vigils.
(H) You know,
he says,
if a monk,
if a m- m- % --
(H) <Q if ever a monk could've gained heaven through his monkery,
(H) it would have been I.
[@ (H) @@ (H) You see?
ANY:	[(LAUGHTER)]
FOSTER:	(H) I mean,
(H) I mean @>,
(H) if ever a monk],
could've gained heaven through his monkery,
it would've [been I].
UD:	            [@=]
FOSTER:	(H) Because he d- he did everything,
.. that he thought would,
.. would make God respond .. sympathetically to him.
And and pacify= this righteousness.
(H) And he was always miserable.
... (TSK) And then he discovered,
(H) it's nothing that I do=.
... It's what I accept in faith.
.. Namely,
... the sacrifice of Christ,
the vicarious sacrifice of Christ,
for my sin on the cross,
(H) I reach out,
.. I accept that,
... %as my --
.. and .. and then the righteousness of God,
(H) is .. imputed to me.
... It's given to me.
... The .. <MRC the just (H) shall live .. by faith MRC>.
... And so,
(H) this life .. in God comes to you not,
.. <ot,
it's not God %>,
th- this <L2 deus absconditus L2>,
this concealed God,

this angry God,
this God who's waiting to throw you into Hell at any minute,
(H)= that .. that was the image that Luther had.
And now you see,
and and and works were associated with this.
His works.
What do I have to do,
(H) what do I have to do to placate him.
What do I have to do to please him.
(H) And now you see the breakthrough comes.
(H) So,
(H) Luther,
from his point of view,
you see,
he's coming at it from an angle of a .. of an Augustinian monk.
He's coming at it from that.
With this travail of soul.
This agony and anguish (H) of looking for this God.
(H) So,
(H) he is,
.. after this discovery,

(H) he is going to .. detest (H) anything .. in theology,
(H) which smacks of (H) human effort,
... or human work,
... sufficient ... to please God,
.. or to placate God.
(H) N=o.
... There is nothing you can do to please God.
(H) .. God .. loves you,
.. he gives you his grace,
(H) totally (H) out of his grace,
.. and n=othing from your merit.
... So the human will (H) cannot,
.. you cannot decide (H) to accept God,
and his grace.
... Even the gift of faith.
It's interesting in um,
.. (TSK) in Bonifas,
in his book= uh,
now he's a French Huguenot.
So you would expect it.
(H) But it's still,
it comes in an interesting scene.
(H) .. Where he's in one of the camps.
It's in the second world war,
he's in the concentration camp in Germany,
... (TSK) and it's very,
b- it's a beautifully written book.
And and he=,
uh,
he's in this scene,
(H) in this camp,
.. and,
... you know,
(H) .. you just wanna give up,
a(Hx)_I mean,
(Hx)_every day is,
(H) you're hanging onto life ... by your .. fingernails.
(H) And u=m,
.. he said,
... every day,
we just lived for one day.
We lived one day at a time.
And then he said it dawned on me,
(H) that um,
.. I I prayed,
I lifted up my= voice to the Lord,
we prayed together,
and I prayed,
and,
(H) and he said then it came to me.
.. (H) That .. what sustains me in this situation,
in this concentration camp,
.. (H) what sustains me,
.. is my=,
... <MRC my d=eep f=aith .. in God MRC>.
<P ... And then he said,
... and then it dawned on me,
... that this deep faith,
which I have in God,
... is not ... my creation.
... Well that's interesting,
isn't it.
... (H) This faith ... was given me.
... I did not create it,
... I did not conjure it up,
... it came to me.
... It was given to me.
... That's the testimony of a Huguenot.
.. (H) Inmate .. in a concentration camp P>.
.. (H) Well let's take a break.

 (H) Alright,
ll I- --
think uhm,
. (TSK) (H) .. You know I --
think,
 probably,

t so much anterior cruciate,
ich is good,
) um,
. the medial collateral ligament,
at .. l=igament here is just minimally hurt,
 (H) .. uh,
think so=me of that ... posterior cruciate was probably already r- there,
d the reason I'm saying that is,
cause it really ... doesn't hurt that much when I pull on it.

 This is the one that [pulls on that] --
REN:	[It feels tight though] a bit.
D:	.. Mhm.

d when I pull on this one,
REN:	... That [does hurt].

,

u know,

etty simple,
u know,
 if they've been hurt,
ey gonna hurt when you stretch em.
u know,
,

 a lot of that's been there,
 (H) you may have hurt it a little bit more,
 you know,
 and y%- --
 you got this one a little bit,
d this one a little bit,

REN:	.. No need for surgery to make it [better]?

u know,

 something.
u know what I mean,
u know,
don't know.
u know,
u'll just have to --
 <X Try to X> have to see how it plays out.
t it it's gonna be minimal.
. (H) And you can z- --
. You can overcome that a little bit,
 getting your .. muscle .. in better shape.
. (TSK) There are two things that stabilize your knee.
) This is your knee brace,
e big muscle above your knee is the brace for your knee,
at's what holds it together when you're doing things.
) In fact,
u know,
l the sports players they --
eir ligaments have been stretched so much and,
paired,
d stretched,
d repaired,
at they --
ey're just not much good,

s what they do.
REN:	[They do a lot of leg lifts]?
D:	(H) S]o right.

 you know just,

 uh,
u can do straight leg lifts,
 (H) what we call just those .. little short extensions,

 little short extensions with weight,
REN:	... Mhm?

REN:	... Mhm?
D:	... you wanna b- --
u --
at you wanna do,
d you can just do isometrics,
u can just .. l=ock your knee real stiff,
d just tighten your muscle,
ld it tight as you can for three seconds,
d then let it rest for three seconds,
d then tight for three seconds,
d then rest.

. %= all kinda ways.
 just whatever the day will al- .. permit,

 you're sitting around,
d you got some time to do some ... isometrics,
u can do that,

u know,
ere you didn't --
sn't getting yourself in awkward positions,

 getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something,
u know,
u could probably handle it okay.
 (H)= ... I think,

   	and yet he's saying that they have no power.
   	.. (H) Well power is relative ... as well.
   	right?
   	.. It's relative.
   	It's relational.
   	... Power is relational.
   	... How can you measure power.
   	... Power is impossible to measure.
   	... Alright?
   	.. In other words,
   	you cannot break power apart into vi_ __
   	(H) various ingredients,
   	.. and say,
   	... A,
   	... B,
   	... C,
   	... D,
   	these are the ingredients of power.
   	(H) .. We can make generalities.
   	... Position.
   	... Wealth.
   	... All these different things that I've talked about.
   	(H) But power is difficult to measure.
   	... So that,
   	.. we must deal with the whole question of empowerment,
   	... from also the perspective of potential power (H) versus actual power.
   	... There is a difference.
   	... If I am,
   	... for example,
   	... the president (H) .. of .. a major labor union,
   	.. or a major corporation.
   	... the position,
   	.. (H) as president of that entity,
   	... gives me so much power.
   	... But yet if I do not know how to utili=ze,
   	... that entity in terms of its mobilization,
   	(H) .. for a given objective,
   	.. like a labor union.
   	.. If I have fourteen million people as members,
   	(H) and I don't show any manifestation of power,
   	am I powerful.
   	... Well,
   	.. it has to be measured by what ... you're trying to do.
   	what the objectives are.
   	... Example.
   	... L=abor today,
   	is being challenged by perhaps one of the most ... serious ... pieces ... of __
   	... not legislation per se,
   	because it's not in a legislative form yet,
   	(H) but,
   	.. a proposed North American Free Trade Agreement,
   	... that if passed by Congress,
   	.. is going to impact ... three economies.
   	... Canada,
   	.. U.S.,
   	.. and Mexico.
   	... (H) L=abor,
   	as a sector,
   	... is going to be the most .. impacted.
   	... How is labor today ... mobilizing .. its great power.
   	... Uh not just the AFL_CIO and its fourteen million members,
   	(H) but the United Auto Workers,
   	.. and many other or_ .. labor organizations,
   	.. what are they doing.
   	.. to influence .. public .. policy.
:  	... Combining power.
YA: 	... Huh?
:  	.. They're combining their power.
YA: 	.. How are they combining their power.
:  	.. By al_ allying with other,
   	.. um,
   	... (TSK) unions [<X of workers X>].
YA: 	                 [Alright,
   	they're they're they're] forming coalitions,
   	.. among themselves,
   	they're forming coalitions with who.
   	Environmental groups.
   	right?
   	... Cause .. environment supposedly is going to be also negatively impacted.
   	... especially along the border.
   	... Alright,
   	.. so there's_,
   	.. there's a lot of coalition building.
   	... But can you say as a historian,
   	... that labor is doing what they were infamous for doing thirty forty years ago?
   	.. Taking [to the] streets?
:  	          [No].
   	No they've definitely lost power.
YA: 	... Alright,
   	.. good point.
   	.. They have __
   	.. He said,
   	.. they have lost power.
   	(H) So your measurement .. of a loss of power is based on what.
:  	... What they can and can't X[XX].
YA: 	                             [Alright].
   	... Alright.
   	... You don't see,
   	... what you've read about=.
   	... right?
:  	.. Right.
YA: 	.. today.
   	.. Alright.
   	.. That's one perception.
   	... Is the Black community less powerful today,
   	.. in nineteen_ninety_three,
   	than it wa=s,
   	(H) ... in nineteen ... sixty ... eight.
   	... with the poor people's march on Washington,
   	(H) .. or nineteen_sixty_three,
   	... again,
   	.. on the w_ uh= march .. uh to Washington,
   	... on Washington,
   	.. when Martin Luther King gave his (H) ... famous speech,
   	I have a dream.
   	.. There were three hundred thousand people.
   	... at that march in nineteen_sixty_three.
   	... Which ... period .. of time,
   	historically speaking,
   	(H) .. was a time where Blacks were manifesting much more power.
   	... Today,
   	.. or nineteen_sixty_three,
   	or nineteen_sixty_eight.
   	... When.
L: 	<X When they m_ X> manifest,
   	they're beginning to get more power?
YA: 	.. % When uh,
   	in in comp_ __
   	[in in __
L: 	[Now]?
YA: 	When] do uh,
   	<X make X> a comparison nineteen_ninety_three,
   	(H) nineteen_sixty_eight,
   	.. nineteen_sixty_three,
   	... during those three periods,
   	.. when,
   	.. would you say,
   	.. Blacks .. demonstrated .. much more power.
L: 	... Now?
   	... They have more power now.
YA: 	... They have more power?
   	.. Why do you say that.
L: 	... Cause they're more recognized.
   	... <X I mean X>,
YA: 	... (H) Does recognition give you power?
   	... Hm?
   	... <P Yeah P>.
:  	... To a_ __
   	.. To some ... aspects,
   	yeah.
   	... I think,
   	.. I think the __
   	the problem with your question is,
   	s_ a different sort of powers.
YA: 	... Ah=.
   	Very good.
   	.. Explain that.
:  	... You have uh,
   	... you have African_Americans more institutionalized,
   	.. in [our] system now,
YA: 	   [<X Ah X>].
:  	.. than they were in six[2ty_eight2].
YA: 	                        [2Alright2].
   	Stop right there.
   	... Today,
   	... they have how many Congressmen?
   	... Thirty .. eight.
   	... Thirty ... eight ... congressional representatives.
   	... I don't know how many they had in nineteen_sixty_three,
   	I'm not even gonna try to guess,
   	but uh probably (H) no more than two or three if they were lucky.
   	... Alright.
   	... Would you say that?
:  	.. <X I would say that's right X>.
YA: 	Alright.
   	... Go on.
   	... What else.
:  	... I=n sixty_eight,
   	... the Blacks were a whole lot more .. mobile.
   	.. mobilized. 
   	... Much better mobilized,
   	.. three_hundred_thousand marching on Washington,
   	.. is an example.
   	... You probably couldn't get that today.
YA: 	Okay.
   	... Alright.
:  	... (COUGH)
YA: 	<X You know with X>Chicanos,
   	the highpoint of the mobilization capability was nineteen_seventy.
   	.. During the= era of the Vietnam W=ar.
   	.. Twenty_five_thousand Chicanos were mobilized in Los Angeles,
   	... %a_ %at the national Chicano moratorium .. against the war.
   	... No one.
   	... has come even close.
   	... With the exception of the death of Cesar Chavez recently,
   	(H) where there were approximately forty_thousand people,
   	... to mobilize.
   	... large numbers .. of people,
   	into some kind of a ... effort or movement.
   	... Alright.
   	... (H) So he's correct.
   	... It depends .. on the time,
   	.. depends on the circumstances,
   	(H) and the form of power.
   	(H) Institutionalized power is different from,
   	... the unconventional form that uh y_ you just described.
   	Alright.
   	.. (H) Well what we're trying to get at,
   	.. is potential .. versus .. actual.
   	... My argument,
   	... as humble as it is,
   	... is that .. Chicanos,
   	... in nineteen_ninety_three,
   	.. are fast developing,
   	... a high= .. potential for power,
   	... but they're a long way= from actualizing .. their true power.
   	... Okay?
   	In other words,
   	they're_ we're still at the= ... potential phase of our empowerment,
   	.. and not at the actual power phase.
   	... Alright.
   	.. Anything else?
   	.. On= those two concepts?
   	.. Alright.
   	... Let's get into= .. discussion on voter participation,
   	and these are kind of general comments,
   	... I don't have the time to give you a lot of statistics,
   	... but I'll give you some=,
   	... general uh= .. trends,
   	.. some statistical information,
   	(H) that will prove a point,
   	(H) that will introduce the subject ... of .. political participation, 
   	(H) in the United States.
   	... Now,
   	a democracy,
   	... the participation of the citizenry is imperative.
   	... It is ... absolutely imperative, 
   	... if it's to be a democracy,
   	to have the people participate.
   	(H) Now what am I trying to say.
   	... What am I trying to say.
   	... It is .. imperative for the people to participate,
   	... in the political process.
   	.. Another way of saying it.
   	.. What am I saying.
YN: 	... We have to vote,
   	... <X everyone X>,
YA: 	... But why is it important,
   	... in a democracy for the people to participate.
   	... Just deal with the question.
   	... Not the methods,
YN: 	.. <X You mean X> becaus=e .. if= ... the people don't v=ote,
   	.. it will be=,
   	... there will be an elite group,
   	it'll be .. m=ore of a .. m=onarchy,
   	... that has control,
   	... [it won't be] a democracy.
YA: 	    [Okay],
   	what's a monarchy.
:  	... [Kings],
:  	    [One ruler],
YN: 	... Well [2one2] __
:  	         [2Royalty2].
YA: 	... What?
:  	[One ruler],
:  	[Royalty],
   	... [2or one family2].
YN: 	    [2XXXX2]
YA: 	.. Alright.
   	... Close.
   	... There's a royal .. type of family right,
   	... [king],
YN: 	    [Yeah].
YA: 	... not elected,
   	.. alright,
   	... hereditary,
   	et cetera et cetera,
   	.. alright.
   	... But what am I getting at.
   	... %W_ what's the= essence of what I'm asking for?
   	... Yes.
   	.. Fire away.
:  	... By= ... its very nature,
   	.. democracy demands ... voting.
   	Without vo[ting XX] __
YA: 	          [Ah].
   	.. Stop right there.
   	.. You made a statement.
   	By the very nature of democracy.
   	.. (H) What is a democracy.
:  	... Democracy is rule by the people.
YA: 	... Alright.
   	.. (H) <L2 Demos ... cratos L2>.
   	right?
   	... [People] ... rule.
:  	    [XX]?
YA: 	Another Greek word.
   	.. The Greeks were .. major contributors to this political process of development,
   	.. of concepts.
   	<L2 Demos ... cratos L2>.
   	People ... govern,
   	or people rule.
   	.. Alright.
   	... We tell the world,
   	... that democracy ... is what .. we practice.
   	Is that correct?
   	.. Is that what we tell the world?
   	... Yeah.
YA: 	Yes?
   	.. Alright.
   	Would you agree <X with that X>?
   	.. Okay.
   	.. What else do we say,
   	selling ... our political system.
   	... (H) In selling our political system,
   	... we make it synonymous,
   	... synonymous .. by saying= that,
   	.. we don't distinguish,
   	... the form of economic system,
   	... versus the political system,
   	(H) and that we put it in the same kettle.
   	.. (H) Democracy,
   	... and capitalism,
   	... are essentially the same.
   	... Are they the same.
:  	... No.
YA: 	.. No.
   	... But yet we do.
   	.. (H) A=nd,
   	.. if we= .. listen carefully,
   	.. and read carefully,
   	... a=ll these books on international relations,
   	... foreign relations and so forth,
   	... what is it that we tell the world,
   	.. that America is.
   	... The cradle .. of democracy.
   	... We are the cradle of democracy,
   	(H) we are the bastion of the free world,
   	... et cetera et cetera et cetera.
   	.. And when (H) Ronald Reagan was in power,
   	... we talked about the evil empire.
   	right?
   	.. (H) Categorizing,
   	... uh=,
   	the Soviet Union,
   	... and the so_called Communist empire,
   	as a evil empire.
   	... Alright.
   	... I say this because,
   	(H) .. there is,
   	.. a tendency for some of us to= believe,
   	because,
   	.. we have been conditioned.
   	right?
   	... Who conditions us to think the way we think.
   	.. What did we deci_ __
   	.. What did we say.
   	.. earlier.
   	... talking about culture.
L: 	... Um,
   	.. they learn through .. schools,
   	.. [<X through their families X>].
YA: 	   [Schools.
   	right]?
   	... Schools.
   	... The media.
   	.. Everything else.
   	.. (H) .. I mean,
   	.. doesn't the media tell us that there's only a two_party system in this country?
:  	.. Mhm.
:  	.. Mhm.
   	Why is it
   	.. that the Communist Party,
   	the Socialist Workers Party,
   	the Prohibitionist Party,
   	the American Independent Party,
   	(H) ... all these parties that we have,
   	... supposedly minority parties,
   	... don't get the same kind of treatment,
   	... as the Democratic and Republican parties.
   	... They're not mainstream.
   	right?
   	... We have a two-party system.
   	(H) We are taught from the very beginning that there's only two parties.
   	.. That's a l- different subject.
   	.. But I'm --
   	.. What I'm --
   	The point I'm trying to make is that,
   	.. if we look ... into the realities,
   	.. of what we have as a political system,
   	... we tell the world,
   	that in this country democracy is very much alive,
   	because we ha=ve,
   	a congress,
   	we have,
   	(H) a supreme court,
   	.. we have a presidency,
   	(H) we have a political system=,
   	that i=s,
   	... governed by certain principles,
   	.. and law=s,
   	(H) that emanate from what.
   	... The Constitution.
   	... which is a living document.
   	The Constitution.
   	right?
   	(H) That is very much the document that protects,
   	(H) conceptually and otherwise,
   	... our way of life.
   	.. Our democracy and so forth.
   	... Well,
   	... if we remember .. our Chicano history,
   	... my point,
   	as we get into the whole question of Chicano political participation,
   	%is that,
   	(H) ... it's difficult,
   	.. for us as Chicanos,
   	.. as we get into it,
   	... to understand,
   	... why is it,
   	.. including ourselves,
   	.. because a lot of Chicanos don't even understand why we don't vote,
   	.. why don't we participate,
   	.. and they come up with all kinds of (H) somewhat superficial analysis,
   	... that,
   	.. m=uch of our political behavior,
   	... is a product of what ... was covered in this class,
   	.. under history,
   	(H) and culture,
   	and what did I say.
   	... Two.
   	... major currents,
   	... of history,
   	... two .. major currents of political culture,
   	... right?
   	And what is political culture.
   	... I'll get back to that concept.
   	But just .. general terms.
   	.. What is political culture.
   	... What is political culture.
   	... Alright.
   	.. I want you to think --
   	Put that concept down,
   	.. because you're gonna --
   	you're gonna hear about it in the next few minutes.
   	.. It's very important that you understand that concept.
   	Political culture.
   	(H) But I want --
   	.. Thing I want to underline here,
   	.. is that,
   	.. we are products,
   	(H) of a historical,
   	... dualistic process,
   	... Mexico's history,
   	US history,
   	(H) we're a pr- --
   	we're products of what?
   	... A cultural process,
   	that's also Mexican,
   	... and American.
   	... Whatever American means.
   	Alright?
   	... So those two major .. ingredients,
   	(H) have molded,
   	the rationale,
   	... that I'm using in this class,
   	.. to explain,
   	... why is it,
   	... that we're still,
   	... at the potential phase of empowerment,
   	... and we still,
   	... have a long ways to go,
   	... before we realize,
   	.. that concept that I describe,
   	... called empowerment.
   	... (H) But before we get into that s- .. substance of that,
   	(H) is that,
   	... I wanna just briefly cover,
   	... that,
   	... even though,
   	.. I'm saying that,
   	... Chicanos do not vote in great numbers.
   	... And we don't participate in many organizations in great numbers.
   	(H) The fact is,
   	... as I mentioned earlier,
   	... that even though we tell the world,
   	.. we are this beacon of light,
    	... of freedom,
     	... of liberty,
     	.. justice,
     	and all these different things,
     	(H) by and large,
     	... not ... a lot of people .. participate .. politically .. across the board.
     	... I don't care if you're African-American,
     	... I don't care if you're Asian-American,
     	... and I don't care if you're Latino,
     	or whatever.
     	... Most Americans,
     	... do not vote,
     	... in great numbers.
     	... So,
     	.. it's a double whammy.
     	... Introducing the subject matter here.
     	... Americans,
     	in comparison to Great Britain,
     	.. in comparison to France,
     	(H) in comparison to Germany,
     	.. in comparison to Italy,
     	... we don't vote,
     	.. in the numbers that they do.
     	... Alright?
     	.. I mean,
     	if we had more time,
     	I could give you statistic after statistic,
     	(H) Italy for example,
     	ha=s ... a voter .. turnout,
     	... of ninety percent.
     	... Of those that are eligible to vote.
     	... we're lucky if we get fifty percent.
     	... Are we .. less democratic?
     	... Are they more democratic?
     	... Why is it that Italy has,
     	(H) a much larger,
     	.. a higher voter .. level of participation.
     	... Or Germany.
     	... Or even Canada.
     	.. Seventy percent.
     	... The fact is,
     	that democracy in this country ... is dying.
     	... I want you to put that down.
     	... Cause it's gonna be important.
     	... At least for my analysis.
     	I don't want you to agree,
     	or disagree at this point,
     	just write it down,
     	.. (H) you have plenty of time.
     	.. One week to think about it.
     	... American democracy is dying.
     	... I want you to put that ... who=le .. phrase .. in black and white.
     	(H) American democracy is dying,
     	... and I want you to try to think .. of why.
     	.. As we get into the discussion .. of Chicano ... participation.
     	... And we'll get back to that statement .. next week.
     	... So,
     	... for us,
     	as Chicanos it's a double jeopardy.
     	... That's another point I wanna underscore.
     	... Because if the .. larger general population doesn't vote in great numbers,
     	(H) when you're at the bottom of a political socioeconomic totem pole,
     	and you're at the bottom,
     	... you're at the very bottom,
     	... with all the problems of poverty,
     	and all the social problems that we're --
     	(H) we've been talking about,
     	... it's understandable why,
     	... perhaps,
     	... Chicanos do not vote,
     	.. or participate in great numbers.
     	... (H) Now,
     	.. the literature,
     	.. in political science,
     	... dealing with,
     	... factors influence- --
     	... influencing voting,
     	... are many.
     	... Are many.
     	... Civic Culture,
     	... Almond and Verba,
     	... nineteen-seventy-two or so,
     	... is one book that you can look at,
     	... u=m,
     	... there's a book by .. Raymond Wolfinger,
     	... Steven ... Ronsteen- .. Ronstone I'm sorry,
     	(H) Who Votes,
     	... that's another book,
     	... <X Okay X>,
     	... the literature goes on and on.
     	... But all I want to do,
     	in terms of just giving you .. some idea.
     	... of what are the factors that influence,
     	peoples' participation in the political process of this country.
     	(H) And there are essentially five.
     	.. You can .. probably develop more,
     	but,
     	.. these are general categories.
     	... Most of the literature in political science,
     	... and I think Mister Verba would agree with me on this,
     	(H) that,
     	... people tend to vote because they have a sense of duty.
     	... What does that mean.
     	.. A sense of duty.
     	... They regard participation as important.
     	... Now,
     	... why would you say,
     	.. that this .. is a factor that influences voting.
     	... Now this is a very somewhat altruistic,
     	... uh= value.
     	right?
     	... A sense of .. duty?
     	... Why.
     	... Why would you say,
     	... that people in this country have a --
     	.. Some [people that vote],
     	        [(COUGH) (COUGH)]
TOYA: 	.. vote because they have a s=ense .. of .. duty.
     	... Why.
     	... Right here.
:    	... I don't know,
     	.. probably it stems m=ostly from=,
     	... your education,

ON:	(H) Well you go to so many places,
.. on a cruise particularly,
[you know],
LAN:	[Yeah].
ON:	(H) ... So many places in a short time,
that you get em mixed up.
Now we cant even keep our photos straight without the diary.
LAN:	Oh yeah.
Well you know,
.. y- when you get back from your trip,
... until you make another trip,
... you can remember.
But,
having taken as many trips as youve taken,
(H) shit,
they sorta run together.
Im talking about,

LAN:	to separate the trip that you went on this one f- --
(H) Its tough to do.
(H) ... And uh,

... they're a lot --
thats a lot easier than a diary,
then you can transcribe it.
(H) But uh,

(H) .. all the problems we got with the Blacks,
I was just reading an article,
... I believe it was the paper this morning.
... Where I read it.
Maybe it was New York Times yesterday.
... <MRC Thirty-three percent MRC>,
... of the Black ... juveniles in their twenties,
... are either in jail,
ON:	@ @ @
LAN:	... on paro=le,

... Thirty-three percent.

I read .. in a[nother art-] --
ON:	[And .. that doesnt] count how many got away.
LAN:	.. Oh thats right.
... But thats of the --
... % in their twenties.
... I read an article,
.. within the last three or four months,
... and Im,
I believe Im correct on this figure that,
... <MRC twelve percent of the Black male population MRC> of the United States <MRC is <<POUNDING +in +prison MRC>.
... +Twelve per+cent POUNDING>>.
... Of the Black male population.
As you say,
how many di- --
You know,
how many oughta be in jail,
... probably that many more.
(H) .. But the point I was gonna make is,
... and therere always exceptions.
... Uh .. not to take anything away from uh,
... Percy Jones.
Whose article I read this morning.
(H) .. because I mean he's,
I dont know,
.. what his family had,
but I mean hes,
.. you know hes,
hes c- hes .. hes,
... come out of it.
... But,
... by and large across the board,
((POUND)) ... %=,
... (H) .. theyve just never educated themselves.
Coming from these back[grounds,
ON:	[(H) Well thats the hard p]art.
LAN:	and .. and yet you s-] --
ON:	they havent educat[2ed themselves2].
LAN:	[2And you see these2] people come here from <<POUNDING +Taiwa=n,

... parents cant speak English,
they come over not speaking English,
(H) .. and they,
they excel .. scholastically,
(H) in the most difficult subjects.
I mean chemistry,
physics,

.. (H) I remember one year,

its been ten or twelve years ago,
but fourteen,
were.
Fourteen,

<P I dont know how many there are today P>.
I remember that,

ON:	[Mm].
LAN:	(H) And I just read an article in New York Times.
... Yesterday.
I clipped it. 
For my wife to read.

(H) .. Uh=,

(H) in a country of five million people.
(H) Uh=,

I mean they,
... uh,
ON:	Its ten percent.
LAN:	... the,
... and and the,
the Ethiopians in particular,
had a big march last week.
Because theyre second-class citizens.
The Jews look down on them too.
You know they got a,
(H) they got a,
they got a,
uh,
... a class= situation,
they look different,
they --
(H) And --
Course they havent accepted the Russians too well either.
...Uuh,
... %although the,
the .. the Russians,
a high percentage of Russians are,

mathematicians,

ON:	Ed- educated the [difficult way].
LAN:	[On areas] .. score,

(H) the- the- theres a,
theres a theres a class differential.
Which was interesting.
I I really,
(H) hadnt thought about it in many years,
... how those Blacks,

... I am told,
I havent seen any of em,

th- theyre not like our Blacks.
[theyre],
ON:	[No] no.
LAN:	... Small,

 were going to require the um,

uh,
twenty North Clark Street,

(H) Um,
ut the,
um,
coordinating council felt that it was wise to give the community,
more time,
a weekend,
wo days,
to uh= ... augment .. whatever application [people were gonna] submit,
                                               [(THROAT)]
:	so the due date is changed from .. April .. seventh,
o April eleventh,
oon.
And you can drop off those proposals at twenty North Clark Street.
(H) Um,
same .. process ... will continue,
ut for the changes in the time,
he time that you .. drop off your proposal,

s the uh date for that public presentation,
nd we don't know,
here that will be held,
hat time that will be held,
we'll make sure that everyone gets noticed about that.
(H) During April seventeen to the twenty-third,

a=nd uh=,
uring the week of uh A[pril twen]ty-fifth,
                          [(COUGH)]

 for selection by HUD as an empowerment zone for Chicago.
. (H) Um,
. is- if there are no other questions,
,
 can,
. yes sir.
NT:	... <X I have X> a question.
TY:	(TSK) Yeah.
NT:	.. Worst case scenario.
. After we submit em,
. the- uh the proposal application,
. uh,
man beings being what they are,
 organizations being what they are.
. what .. will the coordinating council,
at does the city propose to do,
. when there's a hue and cry.
. from those who attempting ... to empower themselves,
. a=nd combined with coupled with those who are seeking more power.
. Who= say= unfair,
. this= ... wasn't done right,
. according to ... our perspective,
. or this that and the other.
TY:	... that [would be the] worst case scenar[2io2],
NT:	         [X] --
                              [2worst2] case scenario.
:	(COUGH) (COUGH)
NT:	What can .. the city,
at --
. what can the coordinating council,
. or what's gonna be p- --
 be in place,
. to= ... listen to all the criticisms,
:	(COUGH)
NT:	.. all of the= ... disappointments at,
 not being selected,
. so that,
. let's say optimistically,
 there are some good ideas.
. s=ome oversight,
 something that can be corrected,
. hopefully that's ... of minor proportion.
. So that,
. we can still keep the city,
. running smoothly,
. and becoming more and more beautiful.
TY:	... I don't know if that issue has been discussed by the um coordinating council?
think it's a legitimate issue,
. u=m,
. I w- y- would be willing to take that back,
 have them discuss that,
t,
 I mean the worst thing would be for,
 HUD not to recognize that this is a c- collaborative effort,
partnership,
tween the community,
e city,
e business community and the neighborhoods,
) and,
 I mean it wouldn't bode well,
. for Chicago to get an empowerment zone if,
 if everyone .. were not supportive and on board.
. So,
 I mean that answers your question.
don't know= what the coordinating council's role,
 in that case would be.
. But we'll .. definitely take that message back.
. <X on that [question I- X>] --
NT:	               [May I propose] that the coordinating council consider,
. my .. individual worst case scenario,
. and any other worst case scenarios,
at they .. collectively <X might come up with X>.
. Notwithstanding #Paul #XX's suggestion,
. that the empowerment zone ... moneys,
hundred million,
. CTA green line,
ree-hundred million,
. be utilized,
 effectively and efficiently,
. to get a bigger bang for the buck.
TY:	... kay XX,
E:	.. I just wanted to say that,
 there's also some other opportunities for,
. um,
. organizations that are new,
 in the networking process,
d I think that the more meetings you can attend,
d the more ... organizations,
. that hear your voice.

E:	the better.
. There's uh,
. a networking meeting going on,
 on Friday.

 the <X Mega X> Center.

 organizations like CRCC,
. the <X Mega X> Center,
e COBCU,
 Women's Business Development Center,
. Small Business Development Center,
couldn't even begin to mention the list,
cause there's about twenty-five different assist and nonassist agencies on there.
. But I think that,
 anybody who belongs to an organization,
. um,
. that ... has any type of .. connection with the city,
 it would be good to --
NT:	Twenty-sixth where.

 could divide the city.
 Best case scenario would be the- %,
 provisions were made,

ether or not the city of Chicago is designated for anything.

 <X this went on and X>,

t an effective,

r getting this done.
. Uh,
:	... (COUGH)
TY:	I think [that that's the expecta]tion of the --
:	        [It doesn't --
 doesn't address] --
TY:	[2of the XXXX2].
:	[2% It doesn't address the fact2] that,
 one,
 community organizations,
 (H) um,
d many are- .. of them being service providers,
 do not necessarily ha=ve,

 community residents do.
ey've got different agendas,
ey've got different .. priorities,
ey've got different .. purposes.
. than,
. members of the r- the community themselves.
. (H) U=m,
. the second thing is that,
 people who do not live,
 directly inside,
) the areas that are gonna be part of the empowerment zo=nes,
. they've got an overriding concern in this because,
) as Mr. #Pollack said,
hundred  million dollars is just gonna be a drop in the bucket.
. To be able to make these things work,
d especially to make them work over a ten year process,
) that this is calling for,
. there're gonna be a lot of community ... resources,
 s- --
 uh,
. from the federal government,
. from the state,
. county,
. and city,
at are gonna need to be .. marshalled,
ey're gonna need to be,
 reallocated to this area.
. And to be able to have a consensus,
t just within .. the empowerment zone,
t within the city itself,
 these services.
. Are gonna be provided and maintained,
. over the ten years,
. through different administrations,
. through different aldermen,
. political processes,
 involved,
. these people are not being brought into the decision-making process beforehand.
. And I think this speaks to these people's concern,
) [that] --
TY:	    [These people] meaning who.
 The --
:	I I heard several people,
is .. this r- --

 I'll just have to --
 woman in yellow,

at,
. there's gonna be 0h,
 uh earlier that very first speaker,
ntleman uh,
d #Smith.
. Uh,
. that you're gonna be receiving a number of ... proposals,
. and,
. you say you don't know how many,
don't know how you're gonna have,
. twenty-eight .. thirty-two people that you said,
 a coordinating council read,
. maybe a hundred proposals,
. within a week's time,
. and be able to ... arrive at one ... selected empowerment zone,
. it seems to me that it- .. be much more beneficial,
 if the entire community as a whole,
. was brought into this process,
 and,
. this is what I'm bringing up is,
e idea  of participation.
. True community-based citizen participation.
. would involve ongoing series of meeting,

 [would be organizing and directing on an] 0ngoing  0.000000e+00ven nightly basis,

right?
TY:	Although [I do think,

TY:	that the] organization,
s a responsibility.
 If they're [interested] in this,

:	[3Undoubtedly3].
TY:	to get involved in the process,
d find a way to make that [happen XX].
:	[M- my second] question would be on the process,
the city obviously's got its own priorities,
's got,
. u=m,
. funds already allocated in budget,
's got areas designated that they would like to see worked on,
. a=nd,
. my question as far as the process is c- --
y the selection goes,
 are um,
. what --
 which is gonna drive which.
. How much weight are gonna be given to=,
. u=m,
. proposals,
ich .. dovetail into .. existing programs,
at the city has,
,
 that the city is intending on implementing in certain areas,
 and how much is the city willing to bend and say,
. I will g- --
 are gonna forego ... these uh .. scheduled or proposed projects,
 be able to dovetail into .. empowerment zones.
NT:	... What's being said,
atty is,
. when is the city going to present,
y for instance,
. its overall plan,
r conducting the city.
 everyone can see,
 their seat,
 in the auditorium,
 or their .. place around the table,
. and how long will they have to wait for their turn for development,
 when will their interests be served,
. so,
. this empowerment zone,
 simply seems to me,
 opening a Pandora's Box.
TY:	... Go ahead.
. Well to --
t me answer your question in terms of the um,
. uh,
. proposed plans,
 I mean right now,
. the= ... um coordinating council,
 making the selection,
sed on the information,
. tha=t is received from the community.
. And obviously there % there are ... other issues to look at,
 for example,
. um,
ganizations that may be involved in .. um .. current work,
. their ability,
w organizations,
w ideas,
) I mean all that is getting- --
 is thrown in the pot.
) and I don't think that any .. community that has an existing plan,
 has a leg up,
. o=n any one else who has a new idea that may not be part of a plan.
:	... Uh,
 are they explaining the uh- --
r example I --
 don't know if #Londa #White is here,
 uh theoretical- --
. at a uh,
. a .. uh community meeting last month,
 which uh a lot of uh selection criteria were,
. uh,
. drawn up,
 was wondering,
 is the council ... gonna absorb that into the [selection process also],
TY:	[The council,
s] uh,
ceived a copy of that,
d the council has seen portions of uh,
. of the Seaway principles,
) some of those principles have been --
 are [included] in what we have tonight,
:	       [(COUGH)]
TY:	.. Others are really principles,
=r the zo=ne itself,
) and how the makeup of the zone will be.
. And that is going to be handed out to the uh .. Coordinating Council,
is Thursday.
:	... Uh,
 m- m- my third question is on the final program?
. I- .. think this gentleman again spoke very,
 very adequately to it,
 u=m,
 it seems to me,
ain,
. this idea of building consensus.
. That,
 if we're able to make this --
program like this work,
er .. such a long time.
. That the city --
 and in fact it's= stated in the uh,
. uh=,
oposal,
e uh .. HUD ... application proposal that,
. the uh,
. governing body,
. making the application,
 must provide a- .. -ssurance and evidence,
at this uh,
. uh empowerment zone plan,
 gonna be adhered to and implemented,
d it seems to me that,
. one of the ... most fundawen- .. fundamental and best ways to have this done,
. would be for the city to come up with a com[prehensive plan],
:	                                               [(COUGH) (COUGH)]
:	.. that follows guidelines,
at would ... ensure,
. that what's happening in the empowerment zone,
 indeed the seed program that's gonna be followed,
d be able to be dis- ... distributed to other areas of the city and,
. and built on in other areas of the city,
 does the city have .. any,
. uh,
. plans,
 any any ... hope of,
 coming up with a comprehensive plan,
r developing the city?
TY:	... We do not have a comprehensive plan for .. the city of Chicago.
AN:	... Does the city have &
ATTY:	.. We have &
AN:	& any [hopes of],
ATTY:	    & [policies] for development,
.. and we have been identifying (H) places,
... that have plans,
.. and .. trying to get things done.
(H) A comprehensive plan,
requires,
(H) uh,
.. the infusion of .. many many dollars,
.. much more than is available,
... you know,
.. within the city budget,
to implement a plan,
... a=nd,
at this point,
we are looking at,
ways to be strategic,
... in how we invest our money,
... and the empowerment zone is an 0.000000e+00- is an example,
... of an of an area where we are going to .. do some strategic planning along with the community,
which will lead to implementation,
and investing in our plan.
AN:	... Correct.
Would you say it's only,
... we only have policy guidelines.
and when- --
.. when administrations change,
.. policies change.
... What I'm talking about is that,
... cities that we are competing against,
Seattle,
.. San Antonio,
Minneapolis,
.. they've got,
... comprehensive plans,
for the development of their cities.
... And,
[that] --
ATTY:	[some of] them do and some of them do not.
AN:	The ones that I just mentioned do.
ATTY:	%
AN:	.. Alright?
ATTY:	(Hx)
AN:	And,
.. my [point is,
ATTY:	      [Some of them do,
AN:	that],
ATTY:	and] some of them do not.
AN:	... The ones that I just mentioned do.
... And,
.. my --
... my point is,
... that,
it seems to us that,
it- it- .. it seems to me that,
it would give us= as .. Chicago,
(H) a much better footing with government,
if we said,
that we had a comprehensive plan,
that was gonna ensure,
.. that these things are going to be,
ATTY:	.. Well sir,
AN:	[XX XX X]
ATTY:	[considering that our plan] is due June thirtieth,
(H) and considering that between now and then,
we will not have a comprehensive plan,
for the city of Chicago,
(H) u=m,
... I'm not quite sure where to go with your question.
UD:	.. (COUGH) (COUGH)
ATTY:	... Oh I'm s- --

I'm sorry #Derek.
EREK:	Um,
.. My name's #Derek #Williams,
I'm --
.. I'm with the HORN association of men,
.. a=nd uh,
... %I I think we need to recognize that uh,
... uh this is an opportunity,
and it's not a threat.
... Uh,
... consensus do not build themselves.
.. A=nd,
and if we just be perfectly honest with each other,
... the only reason that we're all in this room is because we hear=d,
.. about a hundred million dollars.
ANY:	(LAUGHTER)
EREK:	And that's what everybody's worried about.
... Uh,
... it's impossible for any city to have a comprehensive plan,
because we don't have comprehensive people.
... First of all.
... And I think we just need to,
... given the information that's out there,
... we need to try to make it as meaningful as we can to our constituents.
... Uh=,
... be honestly speaking with you,
... uh I come from an organization with ... five hundred members,
... and empowerment zone has .. absolutely no meaning,
... to just about eighty percent of our population.
... For the simple reason,
... we get caught up in,
... in in all of the rhetoric,
.. u=m,
.. we we constantly challenge each other,
and I- --
I don't think this is the time for that.
... I I think we should be trying to focus o=n,
... the information that's available,
... and and and meet the challenge.
And I and I think we can do that.
.. And in --
.. and again,
this is an opportunity,
... to .. m=eet the challenge.
ANY:	.. ((APPLAUSE))
ATTY:	... Thanks #Derek,
that's why I guess you're sitting in the front row.
@@@@
(H) Um #Paul.
AUL:	... #Derek I --
... I appreciate following you.
EREK:	.. Thanks.
AUL:	... Well see I'd've been kinda ... frustrated,
trying to say what you said,
some of it.
... I'd like to,
just for a couple minutes,
... set the record straight,
o=n what empowerment zones are,
... and what they are not,
... according to my own ... understanding.
... The empowerment zones,
... were ... implemented.
... under the Clinton administration.
... They did not start ... under the Clinton administration.
... They started in the state of Illinois,
... as enterprise zones,
back in the eighties.
... The difference between .. empowerment zones,
... and enterprise zones,
is that the federal government,
... for twelve years,
.. Congress never did approve,
... enterprise zones,
.. at the federal level.
... By the time they were approved,
... Congress,
in its wisdom,
... attached  ... funding.
... criteria.
... and shifted the name from enterprise zones,
... to empowerment zones.
... For the record.
... I do not live .. in CHA.
... I am not ... homeless.
... I do not .. transport myself,
... on CTA properties.
... I'm a veteran,
.. so I do not go ... to county hospitals.
... I abide by the law,
... so I'm not in .. county jail.
... I have ... attended .. several colleges,
... I think successfully,
... they think .. unsuccessfully,
... so I do not need .. the public education system,
... in Chicago.
... But,
... I do know,
who does_(/uz/) .. need em.
... The homeless,
... and people not in .. public housing.
... Public housing,
... because one,
.. we're getting ready,
to tear them all down.
... What are we gonna do with it.
... The= city .. has no right,
... <X would be in a fight X>,
... <X we need X>,
... to try and tell me,
... what my block needs,
... When my block decides,
.. what it needs,
... and presents its plan,
... to the city,
... then the city,
.. can take its logical,
... legal,
... jurisprudence,
... course,
... of identifying,
... what .. resources it has,
.. and make em available.
... The empowerment zones,
... what are,
.. by legislation,
... to be planned,
... by,
... with,
... and for,
... those most in need of empowering.
... It don't mention,
... those agencies,
.. most in need.
This is not the entitlement programs.
(H) See the entitlement programs is what has turned the West Side,
(H) into a damn desert .. of oasis and poverty.
... Because the West Side was planned .. for.
... CHA was planned .. for.
... The city .. has put together in a aggregate sum,
(H) the map that is about two pages,
(H) that shows you where the poorest folks live.
... If you are an agency,
... that is involved in those areas,
... take the opportunity to find out what those people need,
.. and deliver the proposal.
... If you are an agency that is outside of those areas,
of the census track,
that each of you have,
... then,
.. cha=nge your location,
... do like Reagan said,
... and move with your feet .. into the area.
... This is no,
you know,
three card <X Molly X> here.
... We al=ready know,
.. where the most <MRC empower- .. -less .. people .. are MRC>.
... Get busy.
... #Patty asked a question earlier.
... I have .. chose not to do it,
... but out of necessity,
... I'm gonna ask you to .. walk through this,
... this is where the poor folks live.
... This is where your tax dollars are going.
(H) And this is why you get upset,
every time the city launches a project,
(H) because you say,
.. it comes in over budget.
... This is where the state .. has roads going on.
... This is where county hospital has roads going on.
(H) So as far as I'm concerned,
(H) if the city did anything more than what it was doing,
(H) I would file a grievance with the Department of Justice,
to say that they were in violation .. of the legislation.
... The legislation says that,
.. tho=se who have nothing,
... are either to be courted .. by those who have something,
(H) or left alone.
... so that they can develop,
.. their own plan,
and be responsible for their success,
... or their failure.
... That to me .. is the empowerment zone.
... Anything else,
.. is a contradiction,
... Malcolm X,
we .. sitting in the college named after him,
(H) he said by whatever means necessary.
(H) So by whatever means necessary it takes for you to get <X gautonomous X>,
(H) touched,
.. contagious,
(H) in in love with ... poor folks.
... is what is gonna take,
.. to keep your agencies,
... empowered.

me and Janine and all of us were walking dow=n the hill.
You know,
g dow=n,
where the pier is?
Except,
ere going down that big hill?
And it's like uh,
me and Janine were used to walking down that steep grassy part,
they went around.
So we hurried up and went in the grassy part,
y= the tennis courts.
It was real dark,
you couldn't see us at all,
r we had gotten .. to that little plank.
So we like hurried up to this one spot we always went to,

 Okay folks,
coming to a short stairway,
e handrails,
 careful please.
((FOOTSTEPS_AND_AMBIENT_CROWD_NOISE))
Okay folks,
s find out where we are.
We got on the elevator right here,
came down and stood on the balcony overlooking the power plant,
. (H) down that stairway,
t on the power plant ramp about that far,
) then right at that yellow line.
) And you're now standing over the second-largest water pipe in the world,
) and it's called a penstock.
. More about that a little bit later.
 (H) The Colorado River,
ows in this direction.
) In order to build a dam here,
e very first thing they had to do=,
) was to get rid of that river.
 (H) So they came up here above where the dam was to be built,
) and drilled and blasted out,
ur diversion tunnels.
) Two on either si=de,
) into the canyon wall,
ound where the dam was to be built,
) out in the river down below.
) Each one of these tunnels were drilled and blasted out at fifty-six feet in diameter,
) and then lined with three feet of concrete.
 (H) You're now standing in one of those old diversion tunnels.
. (H) They then came up here,
d they built a cofferdam about a hundred feet high,
) to force this river into these diversion tunnels.
) Came back down here,
ilt the other part of that cofferda=m,
) about sixty-five feet high=,
) to keep this water from backing into the work area.
) They now had from he=re,
) to here where they could build a dam.
 (H) They pumped the water out of this area,
) and excavated down another hundred and thirty-five feet to bedrock.
 (H) Okay folks,
 you will please,
ke a look at this picture taken during construction,
 (H) looks like a series of boxes or blocks,
acked one on top of the other,
 (H) and those are wooden concrete fo=rms.
) Each one of those forms are exactly five feet high,
) but they did vary in area somewhat,
) because they did not build the dam right straight across the river,
) from canyon wall to canyon wa=ll,
) they built it in the form of an arc.
. And it's called an arch .. gravity design dam.
) Where the force of the water,
ming down the Colorado River hits the face of the dam,
) and tends to try to drive these wingtips further into the canyon wa=ll.
 (H) It's a very strong design.
. They did build two concrete mixing plants here,
) they did pour concrete for twenty-four hours a day,
ven days a week,
) three hundred and sixty-five days a year.
) For two years,
 less ... six days.
) Now every bit of that concrete came down in individual eight-cubic-yard bucketloads.
) Eight cubic yards of concrete into one of these forms,
) the smallest of which is twenty-two by twenty-five feet,
) only filled that form up about three or four inches deep.
 (H) So there goes that story you may have hea=rd,
) that there are workers buried in the concrete here.
 Couldn't possibly happen.
 (H) But what they did bury in that freshly poured concrete,
) was one-inch steel water pipe.
 (H) They came down here in this lower cofferda=m,
)= and they built an i=ce plant.
 Capable of making a thousand tons of ice a day.
) They used that ice,
 chill the water,
) that they forced through that pipe in this newly placed concrete.
 (H) As concrete ha=rdens,
 cures as we call it,
) it produces heat.
. The more you can control that heat,
) the better job of curing you're going to get.
 (H) So they used the chilled water method,
 taking that cold water,
) forcing it through that pipe in that newly placed concrete,
) picking up some of that heat,
) then carrying that heat out and away.
 (H) They felt if they did not use a method such as this,
 that it would've taken approximately (H) one hundred and fifty years,
r the concrete .. in the interior part of the dam (H) to cool down.
 (H) So the system did work.
. And then it hardened,
d they remove these wooden forms,
 <X they X> left voids.
rtically and horizontally these forms came together,
) those voids were filled with grout.
der high pressure.
. Grout being a mixture of concrete and water.
. (H) When this is done,
u have what we call a modified monolithic pour,
) or basically a solid block of concrete,
) which when completed would be six hundred and sixty feet across the base,
) fourty-five feet across the top,
) twelve hundred and fourty-four feet from wingtip to wingtip,
) seven hundred and twenty-six point four feet high.
. <MRC Six point six million tons of concrete MRC>.
. That's enough concrete to build a two-lane highway (H) from New York City to San Francisco.
. O=r,
t another way,
) a four-foot wide sidewalk from the North Pole to the South Pole.
 (H) Then they had to protect that concrete a little bit,
) the next thing they had to do then is build a couple of spillways.
) As you got out of your cars or your busses this afternoon,
u may have noticed those spillways.
) Here they are,
e on either side.
 (H) What they did,
 they came in here,
d they blocked these diversion tunnels off in this area through here,
. (H) closed these gates up here,
) now this yellow part is forever under water.
) Underneath that lake out there,
d completely useless.
) But they did incorporate,
to the design of the dam,
) the balance of those diversion tunnels,
 (H) using these outer two as spillway tunnels.
) Now these spillways were built,
 that the top of the spi=llway,
) is twenty-seven feet lower than the top of the dam.
 (H) This assures us that n- any excess water coming down the Colorado River,
) rather than overtopping the dam,
) overtops these spillways on either side,
) goes into the canyon wall,
ound the dam,
) out in the river down below.
 (H) Each one of these spillways is capable of handling (H) two hundred th=ousand cubic feet per second of water.
 (H) That's the same amount of water that goes over Niagara Falls.
 (H) <X Falls X> three times higher than Niagara Falls does,
) time that water reaches this area down in here,
) it is flowing at between one hundred,
) and one hundred and twenty miles an hour.
. (H) Okay we have protected the spillways,
) now they had to get some water,
 (H) %- into the power plant.
. What they did is they built four intake towers.
) Two on either side of the (H) river,
 ledges above the river,
) each of those towers that you saw out there in that lake,
. are three hundred and ninety-five feet high.
. Each with two-eleven-by-thirty-two-foot gates in them,
) one gate near the bottom,
e about half way up,
) to let the water in.
) The water then coming into the penstocks,
) like the one we're standing over right now.
. (H) This penstock,
u can see on either side of us out here,
) is three stories high,
 thirty feet in diameter,
de of two-and-three-quarter-inch steel boilerplate.
 (H) Made in section twenty-two feet long.
 Each section weighing approximately (H) a hundred and fifty tons.
) Each of these twenty-two-foot sections is joined to the next section,
) using pressure pins like thi=s.
 (H) The water pressure in that penstock out there this afternoon,
) approximately two hundred and thirty-four pounds per square inch.
. (H) Okay we have the water this far,
w we divert that into thirteen-foot penstocks or water pipes,
) each one of em going to a turbine.
. (H) The force of the water turns the turbine,
ich turns the rotor in the generator,
) and generates power.
. The water then coming on the tailrace,
 saw it up there,
) and going on downstream to be used at least .. six more times,
fore it reaches the Mexican border,
) to generate more power.
 (H) Good clean .. reusable non-polluting source of energy.
. (TSK) (H) The cost of the project.
. A hundred and seventy-five million dollars.
. I say project,
cause that includes the building of the dam,
) the building of Boulder City about seven miles up the road,
) the highway and the railway from Las Vegas out here to the dam site,
) and in southern California they built the All-American Canal,
) which takes water to the people and the crops,
 of the Imperial and Coachella Valleys.
) This money was borrowed on a fifty-year term at three-percent interest,
) and was paid off in fu=ll in nineteen eighty-seven.
. The people who worked here,
d they did work twenty-four hours a day,
) average twenty-four-hour work force was about thirty-five hundred men.
 (H) The most they had at any one time was when they were pouring concrete,
) fourty-three hundred men.
. (H) The laborers on the job made fifty cents an hour.
 (H) Highest paid man on the project was a power shovel operator,
) at a dollar and a qu=arter an hour.
. (H) Out of each man's paycheck,
e contractor did deduct each day,
) a dollar and sixty cents.
) Because the contractor was feeding,
) and housing the men in Boulder City,
) and taking them back and forth out here to the job site.
. They did have ninety-six .. industrial deaths.
 The biggest single category of death was classified as falling material.
) Basically falling rock.
. But they did have some killed by explosion,
) some by drowning,
me by electrocution,
) and other types of accidents you might expect to have.
) On a job of this magnitude.
. They did complete the project,
o years ahead of schedule,
d under budget.
) Started in early nineteen thirty-one,
) completed in late nineteen thirty-five.
) Just twelve days short .. of five years.
. (H) Do I have any questions.
:	... What's this overhead pipe here X.
:	(H) The overhead pipe.
) That's the fresh air pipe.
 (H) ... In the summerti=me,
) the temperature of the air outside gets to be as high as a hundred and twenty degrees.
) So they bring that fresh air i=n,
) and they pass that fresh air over a sump at the base of the dam,
) the water in that sump is a constant fifty-three degrees.
) It cools that air down to between sixty-eight and seventy-two degrees,
) then they force it back throughout the dam.
) So it's %air-conditioning without refrigeration.
ke a big evaporative cooler or swamp cooler.
. Any other questions.
. Yes.
:	... U=h,
ring the uh ... earthquake this morning,
 you have any sensors down here,
at .. measure any kind of movement,
f ... str[uctur]=es,
:	[<X Right X>].
. Yes.
 W- v- we have several things.
 First place we have three seismographs throughout the dam.
) We recorded those,
t nobody down here felt em.
) But we do have sensors,
ilt right into the concrete,
) any movement that concrete makes,
 is measured and recorded.
. And they had very little of it this morning.
ry little.
. Any other questions.
:	... How far are you sending electricity.
lifornia?
:	.. Okay.
 Fifty-six percent of our power goes to southern California,
) twenty-five percent of it stays in Nevada,
) nineteen percent of it goes to Arizona.
) What the government did,
 they got together the delegates from those three states in nineteen thirty.
) To allocate the power that would be generated here when this dam was completed.
 (H) California was growing very fast at that time,
 they asked for and got most of the power.
 (H) But by the same token,
s Vegas,
out thirty-five miles up the road here,
) at that time,
) was nothing but a watering stop on the railroad.
) No hotels,
 casinos,
) we asked Las Vegas to take five percent of the power we could produce here,
) and they agreed to do that.
. But that's all they get today.
) Because that contract is good through the year two-th=ousand and seventeen.
 (H) So all those lights.
u see burning up there in Las Vegas,
) comes from power from steam plants,
) owned and operated by Nevada Power Company,
) using fossil fue=l.
ey get very little of <X our X> hydroelectric power.
 (H) Okay folks,

come back and see us again.
(H) Have any questions on the way up,
(H) ask Norm.
(H) Bye-bye folks.
... Okay,
any more questions folks.
UD:	.. What's the .. story with this tile.
... Wasn't this created by somebody?
EN:	Yeah.
... Folks,
(H) the dam was built as a tourist attraction,
as well as being very functional,
(H) this terrazzo flooring you see,
terrazzo is marble chips put down in concrete,
(H) ground down and polished,
(H) this terrazzo flooring was put in here by one It=alian family,
by the name of Martina.
... (H) Okay there's two and three-quarter acres of this uh (H) t- uh terrazzo flooring in the floor,
(H) but the designs you see,
(H) is what that Italian family saw %=,
(H) and interpretated from (H) southwest Indian blankets and pottery.
That's where the designs came from.
... (H) Any other questions.
UD:	... Are there just two elevators down,
from these two shafts,
that'll take you to [XX] --
EN:	[That's right].
.. Two elevators down.
Mhm?
UD:	The rest of it's just solid.
EN:	Right.
... (H) Well there are,
(H) there are two miles of %= tunnels going this way across the dam.
(H) They have a pipe gallery,
(H) they have a drainage gallery,
they have a --
... a uh= ... cable gallery,
(H) and they have an instrumentation gallery.
... And all those things are --
(H) They .. measure constantly the condition of the dam with that instrumentation gallery.
UD:	... Y'all open seven days a week?
EN:	... Yeah.
Mhm?
UD:	... Is it unusual to-,
.. to do the generator .. uh ... room .. floor?
In something like this?
There's just --
EN:	Yeah.
It it's .. in fact,
it was built during the depression,
(H) [and they wanted to make it a tourist attra-] --
UD:	[<X Make it make it worth talking X>].
EN:	It was at that time the largest dam in the world,
... they wanted to make it very nice,
yeah,
it's unusual.
... [Usually] you just have con[2crete deck2]s.
UD:	[Yeah].
[2I would2] --
.. [3Yeah3].
EN:	[3Yeah3].
... Yeah.
... (H) .. Any other questions folks.
... Yes.
UD:	... What are the chances .. of a leak?
EN:	... Hm?
UD_2:	@[@@]
UD:	[What are the] chances of a leak.
EN:	(H) <X Well X>,
.. % it leaks all the time.
(H) You see concrete's porous.
(H) And because concrete's porous,
there's water coming through at all times.
(H) But that's good.
(H) Because if <X there're X> no moisture in concrete,
(H) it dries out,
an=d .. spalls and chips,
an=d .. turns to powder.
(H) Wouldn't make a very good dam.
(H) So as long as that lake is back there,
forcing that water through the concrete at all times,
(H) it keeps that concrete in a stage of what we call being green.
(H) Green concrete's very strong.
(H) So we have a good strong dam.
UD:	... Say ~Ben,
EN:	.. [Yes].
UD:	[what's going] on up on the hill up here,
<X don't [2think it's uh X>2] --
EN:	[2Okay.
.. That's a2] five-story parking garage,
(H) and the new building is a new visitors center.
.. (H) The five-story parking garage will hold four-hundred and fifty cars.
(H) Okay,
the new f- (H) visitors center,
(H) will have ... three revolving theaters in it,
... it'll have a .. seating area for people going on tour,
it'll have a museum,
(H) the top deck of that building will be an observation platform,
(H) we can look back at the dam in one direction,
downstream in the other.
(H) Now,
when that's all done,
(H) they hope to be able to f=igure,
... to handle .. between one point two and one point three million people a year.
(H) Last year we had,
.. seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand eight hundred and eighty-nine people go through the dam,
(H) but we had to turn people away,
almost every night.
... Just not enough time in the day,
to get everybody through the dam that would like to see it.
UD:	.. Hmm.
... Will it have any slot machines in it?
EN:	(H) No,
[but it'd be a] good idea,
UD:	[@@]
EN:	wouldn't it.

UD:	... Have they ever had to use the spillway?
EN:	Just a minute.
... Okay folks,
this does conclude your tour of the dam,
I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed having you,
(H) come back and see us again,
have any questions on the way up,
(H) ask Norm.
.. Bye-bye folks.
UD:	Thanks ~Ben.
UD_2:	... Have they ever had to use the spillway?
EN:	Okay.
.. Folks,
the question is,
did they ever have to use the spillway.
.. (H) Yes.
Just once in the history of the dam,
and that was nineteen eighty-three.
... (H) What happened that year,
(H) is they had a very heavy snowpack in the Rocky Mountains,
(H) .. and that was followed by rain and hot weather,
(H) which created a flooding condition.
(H) We had more water coming down the Colorado River system,
(H) than they could put through the power plant.
.. (H) Every reservoir in the Colorado River system was full to overflowing that year.
.. (H) On July second,
... water overtopped our spillways out here.
(H) Six days later,
it was going over four and a half feet high.
(H) And that went on for sixty-six days.
(H) At the end of that time there was no damage to the dam,
(H) or to the power plant,
(H) but further on downstream where people had built in the floodplain,
(H) they did have thirty million dollars worth of damage,
(H) but no loss of life.
... But that flood's what left that white line around the lake out there.
... That white line indicates it was going over the spillways,
(H) four and a half feet above floodstage.
(H) It gives a false impression,
and makes it look like the lake of the level is low.
Or level the lake .. of the low.
.. (H) Actually we're eight feet above normal,
for this time of year.
UD:	... Wow.
EN:	.. (H) Yeah we had a very good snowpack last year.
...

how he does,

fully the antibiotics will calm down any ... any infection,

a little bit,
about bringing .. art to the prisons %.
Your thoughts,
about bringing art,
.. to the prisons F>.
OOD:	... I think it'd be wonderful.
... Uh,
... I've always been,
... concerned about people being (H) in prison,
(H) ... but I really don't know,
... very much,
... I just think it's a terrible thing.
... That we have so many,
in prison.
... And I'm sure,
... we could s-,
.. what is called s=ave the lives,
.. of endless people,
if they had a creative ... outlet.
(H) But what is a ... young person to do.
... (H) ... Brought up,
... not knowing in any way right from wrong,
no compassion,
(H) seeing bing bing bing,
(H) % guns used all the time,
no money,
(H) drugs,
... why should they not steal.
... (H) ... Now,
... I don't know if this has any value,
it's personal.
.. % ... (TSK) (H) ... When I left home,
I made a very unhappy marriage,
.. in name only.
(H) But the man,
it was a disaster.
And I was,
for quite a few years,
(H) <MRC without any money MRC>.
... And I mean,
(H) I sold w- my own books,
(H) to get money to eat.
I know what it is,
(H) to be,
at zero.
... I was not trained for the world.
(H) I didn't know,
.. how .. to relate (H) .. to the world.
(H) But uh,
once a week,
I always went back to see my parents.
.. (H) and,
they never said .. anything.
They never blamed me.
From that time on.
(H) My mother s=aid,
.. % she always had a very good,
(H) uh,
luncheon for me.
(H) Suspecting,
that I was hungry.
.. And I was.
(H) One day she said,
(H) go up ... to my room,
(H) and get some information out of my purse.
(H) .. I went there,
I opened her purse,
it was f=ull .. of money.
ANY:	(LAUGHTER)
OOD:	... And,
... I had the impulse to take some.
... I knew she wouldn't care,
... % she probably sent me up almost to ... take some.
... (H) And I stood.
... And then something in me said,
... n=o.
... That is <MRC not .. the way ... to live MRC>.
... And I didn't take it.
... Now,
this is just a very poor little example.
... (H) ... But,
... when you have ... no education,
when you haven't read,
(H) I'd read a gr=eat deal.
Of very fine books,
(H) also a lot of trash.
(H) .. But [I'd enjoyed readings].
ANY:	[(LAUGHTER)]=[2=2]=
OOD:	[2Now2],
you have no guide,
when you're a young person.
(H) Why shouldn't you steal,
why shouldn't you shoot.
(H) Why shouldn't you go to prison.
(H) But l=ook .. what we're paying .. for people in prison,
(H) instead of putting this,
.. into education.
(H) You see,
I feel,
... our .. culture,
... <MRC misses the first ... sell MRC>.
... Which I come back I say,
is right education.
(H) And of course,
... % from what I know,
I've never had children,
(H) so I say this with apology,
(H) but I understand,
... that it's vital.
... <MRC For women to love their infants MRC>.
To cuddle their infants.
(H) And from what I've read,
(H) all criminals,
all abnormal people,
(H) it's because they've never been loved as young-,
.. (H) % youngsters.

   	... I'm [3just gonna blow it off3].
   	        [3I think,
   	.. he's3] off the [4board,
   	                  [4(H) I'm gonna4] blow it off,
   	.. he's4] --
   	(H) I'm not [5gonna5] give m- --
   	            [5Yeah5].
   	you know,
   	.. we've done .. everything we needed to do,
   	Right.
   	(H)
   	Right.
   	I think,
   	you know,
   	what !Barbara told me was that,
   	.. !Dolores was incredibly embarrassed,
   	... by his display,
   	.. at this time in front of her.
   	.. !Dolores apolo[gized for] !Ray to him,
   	                 [Really].
   	Oh [2gee2].
   	   [2(H)2] So !Dolores is obviously aware that,
   	Oh gosh.
   	... you know,
   	[and,
   	[(H) .. Yeah,
   	she says,
   	I don't know why he] resigned,
   	I don't know what's got <X in X>] --
   	because he's been miserable,
   	... (H) 
   	... @
   	.. because --
   	w- .. which [w=e know],
   	            [Mhm],
   	.. that's why he was- kept trying to get involved and make it sound,
   	you know,
   	like he --
   	.. and n_you know,
   	he was trying to make it sound like,
   	(H) same old complaint,
   	same old everything,
   	well,
   	... we didn't [have any] complaints.
   	              [@]
   	Yeah.
   	(H)= I think this is [2one of the2] first years,
   	                     [2@I @know2].
   	(H)= that this has been so smooth.
   	And I think,
   	had we [realized] it,
   	       [Mhm].
   	.. we [2would have allowed2] him to take a break ... four years ago.
   	      [2Yeah2].
   	Yeah.
   	(H)
   	.. Yeah.
   	.. Because,
   	.. and it wasn't so much- --
   	it wasn't,
   	you know like I told !Jim,
   	I said it wasn't anything .. (H) .. that <<POUND +y=ou POUND>> did,
   	.. wasn't any[thing ..] else.
   	             [Mhm].
   	I said,
   	it was a matter of,
   	(H) you know,
   	m_~Brad did,
   	.. % and !Pat did,
   	the organization,
   	.. I said,
   	.. which was the best thing.
   	I th- [I agree] with that.
   	      [Mhm].
   	.. I think that was the [2best thing2] to do,
   	                        [2Mhm2].
   	It was a lot of time.
   	.. [Yeah].
   	   [(H)]= .. But I think,
   	... we need to --
   	we need to d- establish ... duties.
   	... Mhm.
   	You know.
   	Which we decided.
   	.. And see part of what we decided with these duties is,
   	(H) .. just deciding,
   	... what we need .. to do what.
   	.. You know.
   	[There's gonna be] tasks.
   	[Mhm].
   	(H)=
   	(H) [As specific]ally as [2we ca- --
   	    [(H) %]
   	                         [2(Hx)2]
   	yeah2].
   	See and I'm .. I'm --
   	.. (Hx) [on one hand I'd] like to take it back to where the secretary is responsible for the minutes.
   	        [(THROAT)]
   	Un[2hunh2].
   	  [2You know2].
   	.. !Pat does [3that3],
   	             [3@Yeah3],
   	(H) @I @know.
   	(H) There's --
   	.. really the secretary serves almost no [function].
   	                                         [Just] i- th- [2not.
   	                                                       [2You know I,
   	it's just uh2],
   	.. There signs --
   	she signs] her name [2thirty times2],
   	                    [2Yeah2],
   	you know,
   	[in the last] f- y- --
   	[Right].
   	[2@@ @Right @~Phil.
   	[2two days ago.
   	(H) Well2],
   	(H) That was2] it.
   	.. [3That was it3].
   	   [3(H)3] That's a [4problem4].
   	                    [4That um4] --
   	I --
   	you know,
   	and I think we wanna do that.
   	We need to say.
   	... You know,
   	!Pat's been= great enough to do this,
   	% ... and if she really wa=nts to do it.
   	.. I'm not gonna %= dissuade [her from doing] it.
   	                             [Yeah].
   	(H)= But one [2thing we have to2] be careful of,
   	             [2Yeah2].
   	that I mentioned .. to !Jim,
   	and I've mentioned it to !Pat l=ightly.
   	.. Yeah.
   	Which is .. to be careful abou=t (H)= saying things.
   	You know,
   	like in board meetings?
   	.. In- interjecting too much.
   	.. [Yes.
   	   [Okay?
   	(H)]
   	I know].
   	Because in board discussion,
   	.. I mean,
   	[Yeah].
   	[o-] on one hand,
   	as a member she has every right.
   	To- .. to speak what she wants.
   	.. [Bu=t],
   	   [Mhm].
   	(H)
   	.. (H) No.
   	But that's[=] --
   	          [The thing] is,
   	.. you know.
   	I've just seen .. some of the looks,
   	.. from some of the people,
   	you know,
   	who feel,
   	<Q I'm a board member Q>.
   	(TSK) [Yeah].
   	      [(H)] And whether --
   	the board you know,
   	if they don't interject anything,
   	but whether they do or not.
   	.. I think we have to be careful,
   	.. Mhm.
   	.. (H) Well ~Phil,
   	that,
   	.. [I mean that goes --
   	   [be- because,
   	.. where that came in],
   	That goes for] me as well then.
   	It --
   	(H) Yeah,
   	it does.
   	[But,
   	[It um=],
   	I think] what's different is,
   	[2You2] --
   	[2um2],
   	.. you've been much more re[3sponsive in3] this sense.
   	                           [3I mean3],
   	.. Okay?
   	(H) [!Pat's more] opinionated in [2that sense.
   	    [You know I] --
   	                                 [2Unhunh.
   	Okay2]?
   	(H)2] I --
   	.. what I try to do,
   	is .. is is just respo=nd [to question-] --
   	[(TSK) (H) X] --
   	and if I need to fill in blanks,
   	[which],
   	[Oh yeah].
   	(H) [2That's fine2].
   	    [2You know2].
   	That --
   	But --
   	See but that --
   	.. your --
   	.. your position .. is different.
   	M[hm.
   	[(H) Okay?
   	.. That's --
   	Yeah that's true].
   	Yours is in a] --
   	.. is a much more official capacity,
   	because you= are the one who answers to the board.
   	Yeah.
   	(H)
   	Right.
   	You have to do that.
   	.. And you are- th- ca=n voice an opinion about things.
   	[(H)]
   	[Yeah].
   	But the biggest deal,
   	.. where I thought it % was an issue,
   	th- where I heard things about it was,
   	.. (H) during the annual meeting,
   	right after,
   	when we had the discussion about the poster.
   	.. Oh[=.
   	[(H) When we brought up the] thing,
   	Was !Pat uh] --
   	!Pat was [2right in the middle of it,
   	         [2See,
   	I --
   	.. I wasn't there2],
   	(H) and she was2] saying,
   	well this is a great piece,
   	and this is this.
   	(H) Well,
   	.. Yeah.
   	you know,
   	.. [I didn't wanna em]barrass her,
   	   [She shouldn't <X have done that X>].
   	and I didn't [2wanna do anything2].
   	             [2I know2].
   	But I just saw,
   	[(H) people] kinda going,
   	[That was out] --
   	.. Yeah.
   	You [know]?
   	    [Yeah].
   	And,
   	[(H)]
   	[That's true].
   	She shouldn't've been [2in on that <X at all X>2].
   	                      [2She shouldn't've been2],
   	% you know,
   	cause that's not part of her capacity,
   	she's not [on that com]mittee,
   	          [Mhm].
   	[2Mhm2].
   	[2you know2],
   	and if she wants --
   	(H) you know,
   	.. % basically the thing is,
   	you know,
   	if she wanted to be a boa=rd person.
   	Mhm.
   	That's fine.
   	I [mean let's look] into b- pursuing that.
   	  [Right].
   	Right.
   	(H)= But see I'm afraid we're gonna lose !Jim because of that.
   	... he feels there's a conflict.
   	And uh,
   	it's definitely gonna [happen].
   	                      [(H)] I mean he says.
   	.. There's no question about it,
   	we've [talked],
   	      [Yeah],
   	and maybe it's right.
   	.. Maybe it s- [it is] gonna be right.
   	               [Yeah].
   	.. You know?
   	(H) .. Well he --
   	... d%= --
   	I mean he doesn't seem to --
   	.. % % you've talked to him and I've [talked to him and],
   	                                     [(H) Well],
   	.. he [2seems to be2] --
   	      [2I mean he says2] mayb- --
   	you know,
   	after the board retreat.
   	[now].
   	[Yeah].
   	.. But not,
   	(H) Well [I a-] --
   	         [<X you know X>],
   	I wanted him,
   	I said I want you to stay through the board retreat.
   	.. [Yeah].
   	   [I says],
   	and the reason is,
   	because I said we need people who know,
   	(H) I said right now we have,
   	... You know,
   	.. f=our new board members?
   	.. Or [five].
   	      [Yeah].
   	.. You know,
   	.. [Yeah].
   	   [Four],
   	whatever.
   	.. Four new board --
   	.. [yeah].
   	   [(H)] .. And,
   	... we're at this point of saying okay.
   	Uh=,
   	.. (H) ... (Hx) ... All of a sudden,
   	.. (H) we have t- all these,
   	.. you know,
   	questions [to answer].
   	          [Mhm].
   	You know.
   	we have all these things that [we have to do],
   	                              [Mhm].
   	and we have (H) this commitment of time.
   	... Uh=,
   	... %and but they don't know,
   	everything that's gone on,
   	[in the last .. years.
   	[They need to be educated as to --
   	(H) See this],
   	no.
   	.. no].
   	this retreat,
   	that's why you see,
   	I think it's important.
   	.. Because,
   	... I mean I realized,
   	.. that I'd never seen the bylaws,
   	.. since I was [on the board] until .. [2I asked for a2] copy.
   	               [Mhm].
   	                                       [2Mhm2].
   	Right.
   	... Yeah.
   	... (H) Now what I --
   	.. what I have done though,
   	is to,
   	.. you know,
   	.. any new board member that .. jumps on,
   	I send them,
   	Good.
   	... [copies of the --
   	    [(H) because,
   	.. I wanna] --
   	.. Yeah].
   	I wanna [2get these .. b=ooks2],
   	        [2but ty- --
   	.. typically they] <@ no one reads [3em @>.
   	                                   [3(H) Well that's fine3].
   	(H) You know3].
   	But it's --
   	[At least they've got] --
   	[B=ut I think,
   	what] I wanna do is,
   	I'm gonna --
   	I wanna draft a letter.
   	... [Mhm].
   	    [Like I said] which,
   	M[2hm2].
   	 [2% says2] to them you know,
   	this is what we're doing,
   	this is the purpose of this retreat.
   	[Mhm].
   	[(H)]= .. To new board members,
   	and,
   	.. you know,
   	.. board members,
   	for a while it was,
   	we need to find out .. what it is we're doing.
   	.. [Yeah].
   	Whe[ther] we're doing .. something right or not.
   	[2You know2],
   	[2Right2].
   	(H)
   	.. [Right].
   	   [I think] we are.
   	.. B- [2but2],
   	      [2Oh yeah2].
   	.. [3Sure we are3].
   	   [3I think3],
   	(H) 
   	Sure [we are].
   	     [the thing] i=s,
   	%= .. I don't --
   	... I need to b- --
   	.. them to .. kind of commit.
   	.. To ... to being responsible.
   	Mhm.
   	.. Yeah.
   	.. And uh,
   	.. (H) I mean I kinda hate to feel like I'm taking .. charge,
   	but th- I guess that's what I'm .. I'm needing to do.
   	.. Well yeah for --
   	[You know but,
   	[y- .. y- .. you do,
   	and you're--
   	(H) .. and that's .. kind of why I'm] --
   	and you're present].
   	.. I'm going to assign things.
   	[Unhunh].
   	[you know,
   	at some] point we're gonna ha=ve committees,
   	.. and we're gonna have,
   	(H) .. you know,
   	.. Mhm.
   	%b=- .. people,
   	.. that'll be given tasks.
   	Yeah.
   	You know,
   	Specifically.
   	[Yeah].
   	[(H)] Like,
   	you know,
   	I didn't need to do all this calling aro- .. to find a r- a r- retreat space,
   	but I figured,
   	.. if I don't do it,
   	[That's right].
   	[(H)] it's gonna fall on you or !pat.
   	.. Yeah.
   	.. Of course.
   	.. Yeah.
   	You know.
   	(H)
   	And normally that's .. [that's what happens.
   	                       [%= That's okay
   	but],
   	I mean],
   	.. uh=,
   	You know,
   	I I'm a- I'm a- --
   	I'm aware of a lot of the things that are going on.
   	.. You [know,
   	       [Yeah].
   	I know that] you're getting ready to leave,
   	and !Pat's .. doing things so,
   	(TSK) (H) [I'd better let you] go get her.
   	          [Yeah].
   	.. I know.
   	[Okay].
   	[And we'll contin]ue [2this2].
   	                     [2Well2],
   	.. yeah.
   	[There] --
   	[In some] manner,
   	but we don't have to talk about it at lunch if you don't want.
   	But I [think,
   	      [No,
   	that's fine].
   	if we can],
   	.. [2(H)2]
   	   [2That's fine2].
   	.. If we can [3go ahead and3] carry on,
   	             [3Um3],
   	... at some point,
   	you and I [I think],
   	          [Yeah].
   	(H)= [2Because2] --
   	     [2One thing that2] comes to mind is,
   	.. is the,
   	.. (H) well the question of .. meeting quarterly,
   	.. is that .. enough.
   	... Meaning having,
   	(H) you know .. the --
   	.. It would [be] enough [2if committees2] were to meet.
   	            [%]
   	                        [2uh2],
   	If committees yeah.
   	... [and] .. that's the --
   	    [but] --
   	.. that --
   	... that's --
   	.. that was !Paul's .. uh .. desire.
   	... (H) (TSK) [And I think],
   	              [was uh] --
   	.. that's what [2we wanna2] talk ab- --
   	               [2(THROAT)2]
   	we'll talk about that there too.
   	[And say] look,
   	[Mhm].
   	you know,
   	is quarterly --
   	... (H) you know,
   	we- would we need to meet every other month.
   	[Mhm].
   	[You know],
   	do we need t- --
   	do we need to meet,
   	you know,
   	.. (H)
   	as a full board every oth- --
   	(H) w%= --
   	We shouldn't have to.
   	[We shouldn't].
   	[If the com]mittees,
   	... [2uh,
   	    [2(H) but these committees2] need .. to be active,
   	function properly2].
   	.. and to <X do their things X>.
   	[(H)]
   	[Right].
   	Basically,
   	you know,
   	the publications committee,
   	needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish.
   	[(H)]
   	[Yeah].
   	You know,
   	.. Yeah.
   	.. They need to become .. somewhat self-sufficient.
   	.. Collections committee.
   	... [@]
   	    [needs],
   	.. you know.
   	.. I would like to create .. collections committee to be something where we're almost matching?
   	... Yeah.
   	.. % .. Funds they can raise maybe?
   	.. Unhunh.
   	... [Yeah].
   	    [You know].
   	If they can raise ten grand.
   	@Well,
   	.. @@[@ (H)]
   	     [you know],
   	[2and have some --
   	[2I mean realistically2] --
   	have some2] incentive.
   	(H) Right.
   	For them to --
   	[yeah].
   	[So that] basically they'd be,
   	they'd get to a point of saying,
   	... [Mhm].
   	    [Okay we] need to be responsible <X with X> this,
   	so that .. collections,
   	Yeah.
   	and publications will be all .. [fund raising] too.
   	                                [@]
   	Right.
   	(H)[=]
   	   [Oh boy] ~Phil,
   	that's --
   	. Yeah,
   	[it's not gonna be pretty],
   	[Yeah,
   	that's where] --
   	.. Because that's --
   	[(Hx)=]
   	[You know also,
   	we may consider],
   	you know,
   	we have one board .. opening.
   	And I --
   	.. we may think about !Gail,
   	.. (H) Well !Gail is very interested,
   	and so is this --
   	we met with another person by the name of !Bill !Ashby.

   	.. At the board .. [retreat].
   	                   [(TSK) (H)] I think it is,
   	because,

   	.. basically,
   	.. people here,

   	(TSK) Yeah.

   	even if he goes off the board.
   	.. Yeah.

   	.. lame,
   	@ @ <@ like cra=zy.
   	@ @ (H) But @>, 
   	(H) it was just,
   	and,
   	oh,
   	God,
   	it's so= gross,
   	because,
   	(H) .. sometimes if you get one that's been thawed out a little bit,
   	.. they start really stinking and stuff?
   	Oh,
   	it's the grossest thing.
   	Oh,
   	it's just so icky.
   	(H) <HI I mean,
   	you have this HI> (H) ... piece of @horse @@@@ --
   	<@<HI I mean this leg that's @> HI>,
   	oh,
   	it's just gross.
   	(H) And like in some of em?
   	... (TSK) blood will spurt out,
   	you know,
   	and I mean,
   	oh.
   	(H) It's @nothing @ --
   	<@SM (H) it's the grossest thing SM@>.
   	(H) And that's why --
   	... that's probably why they have to make that class mandatory,
   	because at the beginning of the year,
   	it's just the% --
   	it's the pits.
   	(H) But once you get into it,
   	it's the funnest thing and=,
   	you know,
   	it's really interesting,
   	to do stuff like tha=t.
   	(H) .. But,
   	... I would have never got into that class,
   	if --
   	.. (H) there's no way,
   	if I didn't have to have it,
   	there's no way.
   	I mean,
   	(H) .. I heard everybody saying um- --
   	you know,
   	like the people that took the class before,
   	(H) talking about,
   	... <VOX Oh,
   	you have to do this,
   	you have to do that,
   	there's dead horse hooves,
   	you know you gotta,
   	(H) and they stink VOX>,
   	and all this other stuff,
   	and I was just going,
   	<Q oh my G=o=d,
   	I'm never --
   	I= don't want to take that class.
   	so maybe I'll wait till next year Q>,
   	and then I thought,
   	no,
   	I'll get it out of the way now.
   	(H)= And then once I got into it,
   	geez,
   	I wanna take the second half of it,
   	it was just really interesting to me,
   	you know?
   	(H) .. But,
   	(Hx) .. (TSK) at first it was kind of a bummer.
   	... But,
   	(H) I'm glad I took it.
   	... Really glad.
   	... (TSK) It pays off.
   	Especially,
   	%_you know,
   	(H) .. twelve bucks,
   	for a trim.
   	... I mean that's twelve bucks,
   	every time I can go out,
   	and trim my own horse's hooves.
E: 	[Right].
:  	[(H)=] You know,
   	and I wouldn't trust myself to do it,
   	.. with,
   	.. a horse that I was really using a lot,
   	or anything,
   	but the ones that are standing around,
   	(H) ... that's still twelve dollars,
   	you know,
   	I mean whether the horse being used a lot or not,
   	that's twelve bucks.
   	and,
   	(H)= ... shoot,
   	I can do those,
   	you know?
   	... But,
   	I always have,
   	anybody --
   	(H) I always have somebody that really knows what they're doing, 
   	for the horses that I'm really really using.
   	... (TSK) (H) But anyway,
   	(TSK) ... I wanna wait until the morning.
   	.. to do that.
   	.. because,
   	(H)= It's just,
   	... too hot in the afternoon,
   	to try to sit out there.
   	(H) I mean you can get,
   	.. just,
   	.. exhausted.
   	(H) Anyway,
   	I was gonna tell you about that %- --
   	... the girl,
   	you know,
   	there isn't mary- .. very many,
   	.. ferrier girl=s you know?
     	And her heart,
:  	That do this?
   	(H) This summer I met one.
   	(H) !Jorgensen's,
   	they have ... one .. shoer,
   	that comes to their house,
   	all the time,
   	they've had him for years and years and years.
   	(H) And I guess like in Minnesota it's real we=t,
   	.. and stuff you know?
   	So like,
   	.. they really have to watch their shoes,
   	for not coming off,
   	because the hoof wall,
   	is so much softer.
   	(H) It's like,
   	when you're down there,
   	your hands are softer and everything you know,
   	and they're not .. as dry= or anything?
   	(H) When you get back here,
   	we have dry hooves.
   	we have to watch out for like uh,
   	(H) ... like the hooves being too= dry.
   	we have to put ointment on em and stuff.
   	(H) The- --
   	Back there they're too we=t.
   	(H) Not this time of the year,
   	because,
   	.. you know,
   	they've had a dry year,
   	but,
   	(H)= usually they're too wet,
   	and that- --
   	... that shoe can just pull righ=t o=ff=,
   	because it's just,
   	(H) .. the hoof wall is so soft.
E: 	... [Yeah].
:  	    [It seems] weird,
   	that that's [2like2] that,
E: 	            [2X2]
:  	(H) you know,
   	and I nei- --
   	I never knew that,
   	until I took this class,
   	either.
   	.. I didn't realize that in- --
   	(H) you know,
   	if you think about it,
   	yeah,
   	if it rains a lot,
   	the horse is always we=t?
   	And it's always moist,
   	and it's always on something moi=st?
E: 	[Yeah].
:  	[(TSK) (H)] Sure it's gonna be softer.
   	(H) But I never even thought about that until I took this class.
   	So it's --
   	you know that's .. kinda stuff too that you think about.
   	(H) But anyway,
   	... (TSK) they always have this one horseshoer,
   	and,
   	(H) this girl's been .. in this f=errier,
   	... uh,
   	she's going to an actual .. ferrier college.
   	(H) They have a lo=t of those around.

   	(H) And she's going to one of em,

... (H) 
is morning we're gonna be looking in the book of Exodus,
d we've been talking about uh= (Hx),
Vision.
And hearing from God.
(H) I was trying to come up with a definition,
act I,
oked it up in the encyclopedia for vision.
A=nd (Hx),
there is definitely a definition,
everal,
uh=,
I didn't really like any of them,
(TSK) (H) uh=,
TSK) .. so I th=ought I'd.. try to come up with one of my own.
(TSK) ... Jim Larson was uh sharing a quote,
from Yogi Bara,
 night,
I wanted to @share @that this morning.
He says you gotta be careful when you don't know where you're going,
ecause you might not get there.
<SM Which says so much,
 we need to know where we're going SM>.
nd vision,
ly has to do with,
having an idea of where you're going.
Our mission is a goal or task which one is destined to accomplish.
... Our vision,
and here's the --
's the definition I came up with,
you can write this down,
uh,
H) uh don't use it unless you,
uh,
gree with it.
.. [@@@]
:	 [(TSK) (H)] [It's mentally] seeing,
   [@ @ @]

H) It's in your imagination,

that you're looking ahead.
And h- ... trying to see where you will be,
n a specific period- period of time.
o our vision for the next few years.
vision for,
uh,
 the ... (TSK) next ten years.
atever.
) Uh,
at is our vision.
. As a church planter,
stor #Queen came,  
. (TSK) (H) ... having grown up here,
d having gone off to- .. to school,
. to seminary,
 (H) God brought him back,
 start a church.
. And he began to seek God's .. uh vision,
 for .. the church.
) And through his own personal experience,
d through (H) ... the Scripture,
. (TSK) and God gave him a vision,
. for a church that was committed to being a part of what God was doing,
) ... a church that was,
. invested in building the Kingdom of God.
. By caring for people where their needs were,
. and by sharing the truth,
. of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
. (TSK) .. Our vision is,
 is a direction of involvement toward a final destination.
. When I started thinking about missions,
.. thought immediately of ... the Blues Brothers.
. You know,
d Dan Ackroyd,
. comes out,
forget what his character was,
t he says,
 <Q we're on a mission from God Q>.
. <SM And that's what the church is about,
're on a mission from God SM>.
. (H) In fact,
t me clarify it a little more.
. The church has been given a mission,
. but our mission is not for us to go and decide what we're gonna do,
. (H) our mission is to participate in,
 to carry out ... God's mission.
 Because you see Go=d,
. is on a mission.
. God's mission is to build His Kingdom.
RC To build the Kingdom of God MRC>.
. (H) To bring the world of lost people into a real and personal love (H) relationship,
. with him.
. Through faith,
 His Son,
sus Christ.
. You know what,
 our vision,
. does not include reaching lost people,
d caring for lost people,
) then it's not God's vision.
cause the Bible is very clear,
at Go=d ca=res about lost people.
:	Yes.
NY:	... God loves (H) .. people who don't have it all together.
:	Yes.
NY:	... God loves people who are hurting.
:	Yes.
NY:	... God loves people who are suffering.
o are seeking.
. And if our vision,
 Uptown Baptist Church,
esn't include.
 In fact,
 our vision as individual .. Christians,
th a relationship with Christ,
es not include,
) ... reaching out,
d touching,
. the lives of lost hurting .. dying people,
) <MRC it's not a vision from God MRC>.
. (H) Because God's plan,
 is,
 and has always been,
 use .. his people,
 (H) to carry out His mission.
. And we're gonna see that,
 we look at Moses.
. (TSK) (H) Beginning in the first chapter of Moses.
m not gonna read --
. I am gonna read some of it,
t I'm not gonna read all the way through,
. because we're gonna try to,
 breeze through the first four chapters.
. (H) Let's look how God was involved in Moses.
. Or how God involved Moses in His mission.
. #Gary
e of the things I want us to do,
. uh,
 building beautiful day,
 build a taller ... podium.
Y:	... (LAUGHTER)[=]
NY:	[Write that on one of those sheets of paper back there].
. We- --
 need it about right here.
Y:	.. (LAUGHTER)
NY:	... Oops.
. (H) Okay.
. (TSK) (H) First thing we're gonna see,
 is that <MRC God prepares His servants for mission.
. (H) God .. prepares .. his servants .. for mission MRC>.
. As we read in --
. actually as we get to= the second chapter,
'll see that,
. Uh,
ses was not only preserved,
 but he was prepared.
. Uh for his part in .. God's mission.
 We have to go to chapter one to get a little background.
. Read with me in verse six of chapter one.
. (H) <READ Now Joseph and all his brothers,
 and a=ll that generation died.
 (H) But the Israelites were fruitful,
d multiplied greatly,
d became exceedingly numerous.
) so that the land was filled with them.
 (H) Then a new king,
. who did not know about Joseph,
me to power in Egypt.
. Look,
 he said to his people.
 the Israelites have become .. much too numerous .. for us.
. Come,
 must deal shrewdly with them,
r- --
 or they will become even more numerous,
) and if war breaks out,
 will join our enemies.
. fight against us,
d leave the country.
. (H) So they put the slave masters over them.
 oppress them and f- --
 with forced .. labor.
) And they built ... Python,
. and Ramses.
. As store cities.
. For Pharaoh.
. But the more they were oppressed,
e more they multiplied and spread.
 So the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.
d worked them ruthlessly.
. (H) They made their lives bitter,
th hard labor in brick and mortar.
) And with a=ll kinds of work in the fields.
) .. In all their hard labor,
e Egyptians used them,
 ruthlessly READ>.
. The king,
 the Pharaoh,
. was a little upset.
cause,
. the Israelites,
o were their slaves.
 who were their servants.
. As they took a census,
 they realized,
at the Israelites' ... n=umbers,
. were= catching up.
. With their own.
 Of the Egyptians.
 And this was upsetting,
cause he saw this as a .. national threat.
. (H) ... From his perspective,
ey w- --
 they r- --
 you know,
 just (H) knew that they were gonna grow to a number,
d they were gonna outnumber the Egyptians,
d then they were just gonna take over.
 You know,
 any (H) other countries decided to attack,
) Uh,
d,
. to= .. to battle,
 uh,
 the Egyptians,
at he just knew that the Israelites were gonna join them,
d were gonna .. overthrow from the inside.
) ... So the next part of the chapter,
 begins to= (Hx),
u know,
rst of all he b- --
 .. works the men very hard.
 said man if I work these guys ha=rd,
ere not gonna be going home to their wives,
d there not gonna be,
) uh=,
) ... having babies.
:	.. [@@]
NY:	 [You know,

at's his first [strategy.
:	    [@@]
NY:	so] let's make it hard for them.

NY:	procreate.
Y:	(LAUGHTER)[=]=
NY:	  [We'll use that word].

use they st- --
ey continued [to --
Y:	   [(LAUGHTER)]
NY:	.. They @Continued --
x) (H) They continued to d- --
 uh],
 have babies.
d they [continued to] multiply.
:	  [@@]
NY:	... So he g- devises another plan.
 He goes to the midwives.
. You know the Israelites had midwives.
ey didn't have doctors,
t they had,
) uh,
men,
. who when a,
en ... one of the Israelite women were gonna have a baby,
en these midwives just come in,
d help .. in the labor process.
. (H) ... Or in the birthing process.
. And so he goes to the midwives and says,
 listen.
re's what I want you to do.
. you go,
d you go ahead,
d you do your part,
 and you help these .. these mothers,
) but if they have a boy,
. I want you to make sure that,
 that boy dies.
. If it's a girl,
u go ahead and let it live.
. And that was his plan.
. Well the midwives,
. you know,
at could they say,
is is the .. the Pharaoh,
 (H) so they agreed to it,
t then they didn't do it.
. Because they feared God,
re than they did Pharaoh.
) And when uh he calls em,
 says what's going on.
ey're still multiplying.
 [There's still boys being born here].
:	 [@@@@ @@@@]
NY:	(H) ... what is going on.
. The midwives said,
 well these,
 these mothers,
. they're having the babies without us.
 You know,
ey're not telling us.
d they're just going ahead and having em.
ey're s- --
 (H) sturdy women.
Y:	... (LAUGHTER)[=]=
NY:	   [It says,
 they don't need us].
 And so Pharaoh comes up with another plan.
 ends up in the ... final verse of this chapter.
 (H) ... Verse twenty-two.
EAD Then Pharaoh gave this order,
 all his people.
ery boy that is born,
st be --
. you must throw into the Nile.
 (H) But let every girl live READ>.
. So he's ordering his people to go.
 And every boy that is born to the Israelites,
. to .. to kill em.
row em in the river.
. Well Moses was born about this time.
. And this is how God preserved ... Moses.
. Now Moses's mother ... loved her child.
. And she didn't want to throw him in.
don't think any of the mothers did.
. And she wasn't gonna do it herself,
 (H) and she was one of these that had the baby,
thout telling anybody,
cept her immediate family.
) ... And Moses already,
. when he was born,
 had an older sister and an older brother.
. And the mother,
 now when I was growing up,
d I heard this story,
just assumed that the mother,
) was hiding the baby in the reeds.
d that's where she was hiding him.
t it says for three months,
e hid the baby,
) didn't say anything about the %= .. the --
 the river,
 in the,
 the uh .. basket.
) Uh,
t then when he was three months old,
 she j- --
e .. was assuming that she was gonna get caught pretty soon,
) .. and so she devised a plan.
 And it doesn't say here that she devised a plan,
) .. but,
lieve me,
. This mother knew what she was doing.
. She b- .. she m- .. got a basket.
. She .. perhaps made the basket.
. Probably did.
) and then she put,
. what they call pitch,
 tar,
 (H) uh,
 it,
 that it .. would float.
. So that water wouldn't come up through it.
) And she put .. a blanket,
 put the baby in it,
. wrapped the baby in it-,
) and she told --
 she brought it down to the river.
 Now she didn't just go anywhere in the river,
 (H) She brought it to a specific place.
 Not just because there were reeds there,
) but because,
 the Pharaoh's daughter ba=thed .. there.
. And this was a selected place.
) The mother took the baby,
) put the baby,
t Moses .. (H) in the water.
. And told her sister to keep an eye on it.
. To keep an eye on him so that,
) nothing bad happened,
) but also,
ere was an- another motive,
at we'll get to in just a second.
. (H) So the w- --
 Moses was floating along in the water.
. The Pharaoh's daughter came down to --
 take her bath (Hx)?
. And she sees the basket.
 And she sends her servant out to get the basket and bring it to her.
) And she opens it up,
ere's Moses,
d he begins to cry,
) and .. Pharaoh's daughter felt sorry for Moses.
. And she just decided to keep him.
. It said,
e realized said this is an Israelite baby.
. (H) <VOX Aw- aw,
or thi=ng VOX>.
:	@@@@
NY:	(H) ... And so she,
 she decides to keep him.
 We=ll.
. Here's what .. pha- --
,
ses's sister did.
. That was her cue.
 (H) She comes out from hiding,
d says,
) .. Oh,
. whatever your name is,
@ [(H) @@@ (H)
Y:	 [(LAUGHTER)]
NY:	says],
 oh,
ghty princess.
. Allow me=,
 to get a nurse for .. the baby.
. I know of an Israelite nurse,
at can take care ... of this baby.
. Guess who.
. (H) <SM Her mother SM>.
. So she goes and gets= .. the mother.
) Now.
. Why do I think this is something that ... the mother knew about.
. Cause it ends up that,
 . the mother,
 not only,
. had her child,
. to stay alive.
) ... But she also,
. got to take care of him,
. and got paid for it.
Y:	.. (LAUGHTER)
NY:	.. So God not only spared his life,
t He provided,
 uh,
r --
. for that whole family.
 (TSK) (H) But especially for Moses.
. (H) So we see how,
. God preserved,
. Moses.
. We also see how God .. prepared Moses,
 (H) because in the % --
. Moses's life is kinda divided into three (H) .. stages.
ch being forty years.
e first forty years he was in Egypt.
. (H) The second forty years he was .. a shepherd.
 (H) ... And the third forty years he was l=eading the people out of Israel.
. And in this first forty years.
. Moses .. got the best training,
. in the world at that time.
. (H) .. His foundational training came from his mother.
. Cause as the nanny,
. and that's what she was at that point,
en though she was his mother,
e was his nanny,
 (H) ... She .. trained him ... in the foundations,
. uh,
ained him,
ught him who he was,
. (H) taught him about his Hebrew origin,
. and the customs of the Israel- ... Israelites.
. Taught him the foundational belief ... in .. the true God,
. (H) taught him of God's promise to Abraham,
) to multiply .. his descendants,
 and make a .. mighty nation,
. of them.
. (H) Probably the first four or five years,
. the bulk of his time was spent with his mother.
. And he,
. I'm sure she told him that,
. that uh,
e was his mother,
s real mother,
. and and about what had happened,
use we wouldn't know about it,
 (H) uh,
 if .. she didn't.
. But not only did he get this religious training,
. (TSK) and this foundational .. belief .. (H) in a r- in a real God,
. but he also,
s exposed to the best education that Egypt had to offer.
 Exposed to the wisest teachers,
d the best culture offered in the world at that time,
) he learned about the politics and customs ... of the courts,
. of course this would help him later on,
 when he had to come back and,
 and uh,
 and deal with the courts from .. a different perspective,
. but that first forty years was spent .. in being trained.
. And he was trained well.
. And he had great knowledge.
. A lot of knowledge.
. That he was uh,
. that .. God provided for him,
rough these ... means.
. And then for the next forty years.
 was exiled.
. From Egypt.
. Because,
 order to --
. thinking,
. that because he was an Israelite,
.. by birth,
... uh,
and seeing ... an Israeli being .. abused,
... uh,
he stepped in,
and he killed the Egyptian that was abusing him,
(H) .. thinking that no one else knew except this person that he had saved,
.. (H) he buried him,
... and then a few days later,
you know,
thinking well it's .. it's all cool,
.. nobody knows,
I'll just .. go on.
(H) He tries to help,
... or tries to intervene between two other,
... uh,
... Hebrew,
... that were arguing amongst themself and,
.. and,
... he tries to be a peacemaker,
and they say,
(H) you know,
who made you judge,
... w- what about this,
you just killed the guy the other day,
(H) Uh=,
and he realized that people knew.
... And he realized if these- --
.. if these men knew,
(H) then probably Pharaoh was gonna hear pretty soon,
and so he left.
He fled.
.. (H) He ran.
... He went out into the wilderness.
... After a few days of .. uh walking,
he ... comes upon a a scene,
where these two young ladies are herding ... their father's sheep,
(H) and uh,
some,
... uh,
.. mean guys,
(H) who knows,
I don't .. remember who it was,
but anyway,
they came up and tried to,
.. to= uh,
... take advantage of the .. two ladies,
trying to take care of the sheep,
(H) and uh,
% ... and I I assume they were trying to steal the sheep,
or trying to steal the women,
.. either way,
... uh,
but,
.. Moses intervened,
and he ran them off.
... And saved their lives.
and saved .. their .. livestock.
(H) And so they invited him to come with them,
to .. to their home,
and they told their father what had happened,
and he invited Moses to stay with them,
(H) Moses ends up marrying.
... uh,
.. one of the young ladies.
.. As #Ken ... shared with us the other day,
it was a .. a mixed marriage,
because these,
.. uh,
.. this family was Black.
.. (H) ... So for the next .. forty years.
... he becomes a sheep herder,
for his father-in-law.
... Who was a .. a Midian priest.
... And during that forty years,
he he g- gained some other training.
.. First of all he became an outdoorsman.
He became used to being out .. in the wilderness.
... And that's gonna be important for him,
for his ... final forty years.
(H) ... Another thing he's,
is,
.. the area where he herded the sheep,
was a .. a huge ... area.
... And uh he got to know the terrain,
He got to know his way around.
.. And that was important because he was gonna spend his final forty years,
(H) in that same area.
and it was important that he knew where there-,
(H) the w- .. waterholes were and,
and where the dangerous .. areas were.
.. (H) ... Uh,
... and so God .. prepared him.
... (H) God also= has .. prepared us,
and is preparing us,
... for h- --
for our part,
... in God's mission.
... God is continually .. building character.
And I think,
... this .. middle forty years for Moses,
was a=,
was a time where God really built character.
Cause he no longer had everything he wanted,
... uh,
at his fingertips,
(H) uh,
he had to learn some things.
He had to learn.
.. He had to (H) learn how to depend on God.
... ON this God that he had learned about.
... From his mother.
... And God is interested in building character in us.
.. as individuals.
... In fact,
God is more concerned about .. our character,
than what we do.
... And how we do it.
... And so a lot of what we experience,
we get frustrated with,
.. but God's ... purpose .. is to build character within us.
... And so when we're trying to decide w- which we should do or not do,
.. something that we're tempted to do,
(H) we need to remember that,
God's more concerned about our character,
(H) and we should .. be obedient to Him,
because that's how He builds .. our character.
... I believe that God has created,
.. and preserved,
.. and prepared Uptown Baptist Church.
... To be involved in His mission.
... To be involved in reaching out to the unloved and the hurting.
... To be an influence.
... to the community of Uptown,
... for the Kingdom of God.
... To be a beacon of light,
... for those who are lost,
... and as our sign says on top,
.. to proclaim that ... Christ died for our sins.
... God has also created and prepared Uptown Baptist Church,
... to be a model for urban .. church .. missions to the world.
... And that wasn't .. our reasoning,
we didn't set out to do the things we do,
so that we could be a model,
(H) .. or so that we could ... get ... publicity,
(H) ... But God has saw- seen fit to use us in that way.
(H) And this is not for our pride,
... this is just ... a reality.
... I'm amazed at how ... people from all over the world,
have have come,
(H) to the city,
and they've come to Uptown Baptist Church,
because they heard about us somewhere else,
in another country.
... or they read a book,
.. uh that talked about Uptown Baptist Church.
... God has crea- --
also= .. created an prepared you and me,
... to be involved in His plan.
... First of all He's called us each to a love relationship with Him.
... Some of us have accepted that call,
... and some .. are still struggling with it.
... But still,
... He wants to have a love .. relationship,
.. with each person that is in this room.
... He's brought us together from many backgrounds,
.. many very different backgrounds.
.. to be a family.
.. (H) A family of followers ... of Christ.
... A family to be involved .. in God's mission.
... Building the Kingdom of God.
... I was talking to #Greg on Friday.
#Greg #Gey, 
... and he was sharing wi- --
somehow we got in a conversation,
and he was saying something about,
he ... he really needed (Hx) .. intellectual stimulation,
because he tended to be more intellectual,
(H) .. and we were talking about why,
some people were intellectual and some weren't.
... And God just ... flashed in my mind.
And I said #Greg.
.. You know God,
... created you to be intellectual,
so that you could relate to others who are intellectuals.
So that you could share %with them on their level.
(H) Because Go=d didn't create us for our purpose,
.. God created .. us for His purpose.
(H) And that's something we have to keep,
(H) ... in --
.. before us.
.. God has created us,
m=ade us like we are.
Allowed us to experience the things that we have experienced.
(H) ... For his purpose.
... And it's for us to= seek Him,
and to know what His purpose is.
... #Papa #Joe has been a,
.. a very strong influence in this community.
... (H) Not because of his education,
... his educations came from the streets.
... And as he came to ... a relationship with Jesus Christ,
he came from a background,
.. that w- had survi=ved,
from the streets.

... Now w- how- --
why= has God use him.
... He wasn't educated,
... he didn't go through special training,
... it's because,
... God prepared him,
... with the experience of his life,
(H) so that he could reach out to other people who are .. going through the same experience.
... So you can't say well I don't have an education.
Or I don't --
I can't speak.
or I can't do this.
(H) You have to know that whatever .. God has given you,
Whatever (H) experience that God has brought you through.
.. That He wants to use it.
... To reach people,
... for His Kingdom.
... The second thing I want us to know,
... (H) ... from this st- .. story of Moses,
is that God reveals His mission ... to His servants.
